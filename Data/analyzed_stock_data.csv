Should I talk my friend out of a $50k investment in $XRT?,1h879f9,rw4455,2024-12-06 23:22:55,0,0.43,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h879f9/should_i_talk_my_friend_out_of_a_50k_investment/,"First, me and my friend talk every few week about trades, only a few $ hundred, but this is the first time he's been willing to make such a big trade/investment. $XRT an ok, but not great ETF that traditionally doesn't get a direct boost from holiday shopping when the individual stocks in the ETF report earnings January- March. 

There's still inflation hurting shoppers' spending; not buying the argument that all is good now because holiday payrolls are up and retail CEOs are hyping up their holiday sales expectations. If it goes up, maybe a $1-2. Is my analysis too negative? I was about to tell my friend to just buy Amazon, but only buy 10 shares, nothing major like $50k. Anyone have any different views on $XRT?

Pros and cons of this investment strategy?,1h85yvo,therisker,2024-12-06 22:28:08,0,0.25,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h85yvo/pros_and_cons_of_this_investment_strategy/,"I have Roth IRA with 150k in it and like everyone I want to grow it.  I know it is a “meme” stock but I was looking at GME with this strategy.

Because it is a Roth, I don’t have any tax implications between shot term or long term.  

If I buy 5000k shares @$30 and then 
sell the 40c for 16Jan2026 for $9.50, 
I get $47.5k.  This is an immediate 
return of 31.66%.  

If I take that $47.5k and do the same - 
rinse and repeat until I can’t buy 100 shares to sell a call against.  I end up 
with 7200 Shares with my initial investment of $150k.  I also have 72 contracts at the $40 strike.  So essentially I paid 20.83 per share.  

So for my investment to lose money the price would have to drop below $20.83 
which is the risk with this strategy.  On the other side if the price stays flat at $30 and contracts expire worthless.  
My investment is now worth $216k or a 
44% return in just over a year.  If it does go up and shares are called away, then 
my account is now $288k or a 92% 
return in just over a year.  

Even if price drops 20% it would still be a 15% gain on original investment.

Obviously with any investment you risk losing it all.  So two questions.

1. Is my math correct 

And 

2.  Would you do this and why or why not?",2024-12-06,0.6486,Positive,"['IRA', 'GME']"

By every metric the company is overvalued. And i get that its an AI play and a defense play but comparing PLTR to other defense contractors and software companies its left earth and has landed on the moon.

In the last 2 months we had massive selling:

Peter Theil: - 24,000,000 shares

Alex Karp: -37,000,000 shares

""America is facing the most challenging national security environment in half a century, and we need to move faster to address these challenges. Combatting our adversaries requires change—starting with activating a whole-of-nation approach that accelerates results, pushes boundaries, and disrupts long-standing barriers,” said Horacio Rozanski, chairman, CEO, and president of Booz Allen.

“We have seen the positive results of embracing this type of change already,” continued Rozanski. “By working together, Alex and I are creating new mission capabilities that leverage Palantir’s and Booz Allen’s unique technologies and expertise to close mission gaps at the speed of now.

IOT: A Potential Dip-Buying Opportunity?,1h81cyj,Ok_Criticism_558,2024-12-06 18:59:18,2,0.62,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h81cyj/iot_a_potential_dipbuying_opportunity/,"Last night, Samsara Holdings (Ticker: IOT) reported earnings that comfortably beat both EPS and revenue expectations. Despite strong performance, the stock fell over 10% after hours. As the market said: “Cool, but your Q4 guidance is $0.8M shy of what we wanted, so here’s a **10% drop in your stock price** for your troubles.” 

  
**What Does Samsara Do?**  
Samsara provides sensors and cloud-based software to help manage vehicle fleets and industrial operations. Their Internet of Things (IoT) platform enables GPS tracking, monitors routes, assesses vehicle performance, and now includes cutting-edge AI-powered safety features.

**Earnings Highlights:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 36% YoY.
* **Large Customer Expansion:** Increased share of Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) from large customers ($100k+ ARR contracts).

**So Why the Drop?**  
Apparently, Wall Street got hung up on guidance. Samsara revised its Q4 revenue target to a midpoint of $335M, which is… drumroll… **$0.8M less than analysts expected.**

Yes, the company that just grew revenue by 36% is being punished for rounding down. This modest adjustment led to a **$3 billion market cap wipeout.** 

**Why I’m Still Buying:**

1. **Big Moves Up-Market:** Samsara is snagging bigger clients and expanding internationally, showing they’ve got staying power.
2. **Innovation FTW:** Their AI-powered **Drowsiness Detection** (launched in October) uses **38 billion minutes of video training** to spot tired drivers. Yawning? Head-nodding? Face-rubbing? Samsara knows, and they’ll tell you (and your boss). It’s next-gen safety tech that can save lives and dollars.
3. **Consistently Outperforming:** This is a company that has a habit of beating its own guidance. Personally, I’d bet they’ll do it again.

  
The way I see it, this stock drop is a classic case of Wall Street overreacting to decimal places. If you’re in it for the long haul, Samsara’s story—international expansion, innovative products, and solid execution—remains intact. I am of the opinion that represents a good buy opportunity of a stock I'm a long term fan of, would love to hear others take on the company and if i missed anything!

After spending good amount of time talking about their 'AI Studio', there isn't  a very direct answer on FCF either, in their Earnings call:

Brent Bracelin

> Helpful color there, Sonalee for you. I know it's early and really look forward to hearing more about the cost rationalization plan, but you do have a bogey here for Q4. Can you walk us through the path to positive free cash flow? I asked because there was an $18 million burn here in Q3 and I'm just trying to think through the rationalization and ability to get to positive free cash flow here in Q4.

Sonalee Parekh, CFO Asana

> Yes, sure. So as you saw, there was some positive movement on sales and marketing and R&D spend in the current quarter. And part of that actually was due to the timing of some of our hiring. But we do expect to get a continued benefit there, again in terms of timing of hires, which is helpful. And then secondly, there are steps we've already started taking around some rationalization of spend, third party spend, which you should see come into Q4. But what I would really urge you to do is Q4. We've reiterated the positive free cash flow, but I think where you'll really start to see the meaningful improvements in operating margin and cash flow is as you look ahead to next year, where we'll provide more detail in March.

Dustin Moskovitz, CEO

> And this is Dustin. I just wanted to add on to that. I mean, we're really looking at, free cash flow is always a little bit lumpy. So we're really looking at the progress on the operational leverage and how things trend from here into next year. So feel good about Q4, but the real goal is to build up a margin through next year, not to just arrive at the free cash flow.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

How do people perform their due diligence on a stock/company/investment? How can you look at a news article and make conclusions about a stock from there? Where are you guys even getting this information from? Is this something you have to stay glued to 24/7 to be able to get ahead of the curve and start making reliable gains?

Intapp has an excellent growth story,1h7ha1b,zedusoup,2024-12-06 00:49:11,9,0.85,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h7ha1b/intapp_has_an_excellent_growth_story/,"I analyzed Intapp, a company that provides “vertical” software for the financial and professional services industries, and although it is not as well known as some of the larger software companies, its stock has performed very well, especially in terms of growth, market opportunity, and financial performance since its IPO. Intapp is stock price has doubled since its IPO and is up more than 60% year-to-date, although the valuation still has a lot of upside

I note that the market for Intapp is services is huge, with a target market (TAM) of $46 billion, and the company currently has a market share of $500 million, which means it has a market share of about 1.1%. The company has demonstrated its strong growth potential by expanding its product portfolio and utilizing a low-code approach, attracting some of the top firms in the financial, legal and accounting industries as clients

Intapp is clients include well-known companies such as Lazard, Carlyle, and EY. The partnership with Microsoft, in particular, has been crucial for the company, as Intapp is software can be purchased directly from the Microsoft Azure marketplace and runs on the Azure platform. Microsoft's sales network also helps raise awareness of Intapp is products

I found that Intapp is annual recurring revenue growth rate was 27% and that the company's net revenue retention rate was 119%, which is much higher than what is common in the industry. The company has been successful in expanding its existing customer spend and further driving revenue growth through new industry expansion

In the most recent quarter, Intapp achieved rapid earnings growth, with its pro-rata operating income increasing by more than 100% and operating margin increasing by 640 basis points year-over-year

Despite Intapp is strong financials, the stock remains relatively well valued. With a current market capitalization of $5.2 billion, it is valued at a multiple of 9.0x EV/FY 2025 revenues and 7.8x EV/FY 2026 revenues based on revenue growth expectations over the next several years

Intapp is a company with strong growth potential, the demand for its products in specific industries has brought it a large number of customers and its partnership with Microsoft has further strengthened its market position. Therefore, I think the investment will be very profitable. Overall, Intapp shows very good risk-reward prospects",2024-12-06,0.9954,Positive,"['IPO', 'IPO', 'TAM', 'EY', 'EV', 'FY', 'EV', 'FY']"

I've been researching both of these companies and would like to hear some opinions from others.

NVO seems like the better company in terms of value, but LLY appears to have a broader portfolio of products, which makes me think their competitive advantage might be stronger.

1. Do you think LLY has a stronger competitive advantage?
2. Do you believe both companies have a strong competitive advantage?

Both companies seem very similar, which makes me wonder why LLY is valued so much higher than NVO. The only reasons I can think of are that LLY is an American company and focuses on a broader range of therapeutic areas. However, these factors don’t seem enough to justify such a significantly higher valuation compared to NVO.

I currently think NVO is the better company and investment.

What are your thoughts? Is LLY's higher valuation justified? Also, do you think investing in either of these companies is a good way to diversify into the medical sector?

"Waymo to expand to Miami, aims to launch robotaxi service there in 2026",1h7clsd,Puginator,2024-12-05 21:36:20,290,0.97,104,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h7clsd/waymo_to_expand_to_miami_aims_to_launch_robotaxi/,"Waymo is setting its sights on its next location: the Sunshine State.

The Alphabet-owned company announced Thursday that it will be hitting the roads in Miami. Waymo said it will first begin cruising through the Florida city with human safety drivers in 2025 before opening doors to riders for its robotaxi service through its Waymo One app in 2026.

The expansion into Miami is indicative of Waymo’s growing confidence in operating its self-driving vehicles in harsher weather conditions in large metropolitan areas in the U.S.

Waymo first tested in Miami in 2019, which the company said helped improve the ability of its self-driving vehicles to navigate in wet and rainy conditions.

“We deepened our learning and understanding of the Waymo Driver’s performance in adverse weather conditions,” a company spokesperson said.

Waymo will use what it learned when it returns to the city with its all-electric Jaguar I-PACEs next year.

The company said its initial territory in Florida will include some parts of Miami’s larger metropolitan area, which has a population of more than 6 million people.

Waymo has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

In November, the company announced it was removing its waitlist of about 300,000 people in Los Angeles, so anyone would be able to use Waymo One to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout the nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County. The company’s ride-hailing service also operates citywide in Phoenix and San Francisco.

And in September, Waymo announced a partnership with Uber in Austin and Atlanta. Through that deal, Uber riders will be able to access Waymo’s robotaxis through the Uber app starting in early 2025, and Uber will be responsible for fleet management and operations of the Waymo vehicles, including maintenance and infrastructure, such as vehicle charging, cleaning and repairs. 

Additionally, Waymo on Thursday announced that it will partner with mobility company Moove to manage its fleet operations, facilities and charging infrastructure in both Miami and Phoenix. Moove will begin managing Waymo’s Phoenix fleet in early 2025, a Waymo spokesperson said. 

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture’s parent company, Alphabet, which also owns Google, led the funding round alongside earlier backers, including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company said it now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week via the Waymo One app across San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles. 

Waymo is the only autonomous vehicle developer that currently operates a commercial robotaxi service in several major metro areas across the U.S., but competitors are looming. 

GM-owned Cruise is working on bringing its autonomous vehicles back into use on public roads after discontinuing its services following an accident where one of its self-driving cars injured a pedestrian in San Francisco. 

Tesla, meanwhile, showed off design concepts for a self-driving Cybercab and Robovan at an event in October. However, Tesla still classifies the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software in its vehicles as “partially automated driving systems,” which require a human to be ready to steer or brake at all times. In an October earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in California and Texas as early as 2025.

SoftBank-funded Wayve is testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, and Amazon-owned Zoox is also testing its self-driving cars, which do not feature steering wheels, in several U.S. cities.

In my opinion, some of these companies have been overly sold and seemingly forgotten about. 

Some companies on my list are ROKU, ETSY, RIVN, ZM, MNMD. I am still researching these companies, and may open a position with 1 or 2 of them. These companies revenues are climbing, a couple have PEs in the 30s, and they all have a very strong brand. 

I am not totally sold on any of them, but just finding it wild how that their valuations were once 5X-10X higher just a few years ago, and not all that much has changed business wise. 

Open to some criticism about the stocks I listed. But would really like to hear about stocks that have suffered a similar fate, but in your opinion, is completely unwarranted. 

I think a lot of the aggressive selling off was very warranted and healthy after 2021, but some of it may have been over done.

TSMC in talks with Nvidia for AI chip production in Arizona,1h75r9y,charon-the-boatman,2024-12-05 15:27:01,200,0.96,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h75r9y/tsmc_in_talks_with_nvidia_for_ai_chip_production/,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said.

TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said.

Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.

The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year.

TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential.

Two of the sources said Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said.

All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan.

Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

Protecting Gains on 300 META Shares Without Selling: Selling Deep ITM Calls Strategy,1h70zrb,ApprehensiveMud5143,2024-12-05 10:06:54,0,0.38,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h70zrb/protecting_gains_on_300_meta_shares_without/,"
I currently hold 300 shares of META that I purchased back in March and have seen decent gains. I want to protect these profits without triggering taxes from selling before the one-year mark (to qualify for long-term capital gains).

I’m considering selling deep in-the-money (ITM) calls with March expiration. These options would expire shortly after my one-year holding period, so my shares would be eligible for long-term capital gains if exercised after expiration.

I understand that selling deep ITM calls could constrain my margin account while the options are open. Aside from that, are there any other risks or pitfalls I should be aware of with this strategy? For example:
	•	Could this strategy be flagged as a “constructive sale” by the IRS?
	•	What happens if the calls are exercised before the March expiration?
	•	Are there better alternatives to hedge while preserving my tax situation?

> The analyst commented: ""Yesterday, Walmart closed its $2.3B acquisition of Vizio, which was announced in Feb 2024. Walmart's urgent need was driven by AMZN's decision to make all 200mm of its Prime Video subscribers ad- driven in Jan 2024. AMZN then linked its CTV ads to actual purchases made on its site, thereby creating the first RMN (retail media network) with ""closed-loop attribution"". Walmart will now ""fast follow"" AMZN and create a better RMN by tying Vizio's CTV ads to Walmart's online and offline sales.

Even if the market crashes by 50% in 2 years, then recovers back to normal in another 2 years, on an initial investment of 10k, you still come out on top.

Year 2: 1,250 DIV Yield (assuming 50% drop across all tech stocks)

Total returns of almost 19% per year, even in a recession situation. I understand FEPI sells covered calls against the individual stocks and not against the index, so if the underlying tech stocks crash, it will too, but I'm pretty sure tech stocks will recover eventually through any recession (maybe this is the logic preventing others from doing this?)

  
I assume there's something wrong with my thinking, or else everyone would be putting 100k into this instead of any other index fund and calling it a day.

Meta Announces $10 Billion Data Center in Louisiana,1h6ue7q,_hiddenscout,2024-12-05 04:49:53,294,0.95,145,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h6ue7q/meta_announces_10_billion_data_center_in_louisiana/,"[https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-data-center-louisiana-location-2828b80a](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-data-center-louisiana-location-2828b80a)

META, the parent company of Facebook, is spending $10 billion to build its largest data center ever in Louisiana, the company confirmed on Wednesday.

The data center will take up 4 million square feet of an industrial site in the northern half of the state that once held a headlight factory.

The center will be powered by three new natural gas plants with 2.2 gigawatts of combined capacity, according to Entergy, the utility working with the tech giant. That is enough to power more than one million homes. Neal Kirby, an Entergy spokesman, said the plants will also provide power to the surrounding community.

“Entergy raised its earnings growth outlook substantially (solely because of this 1 new customer) and the stock rose 15% on that day,” wrote Rodney Rebello, an analyst covering power stocks at Reaves Asset Management, in an email to *Barron’s*. “It’s a monumental deal for the sector.”

Meta spokeswoman Stacey Yip told *Barron’s* the Louisiana data center “will be significantly larger than our other data center campuses.”

The company didn’t say how many GPUs the new facility will be able to support. Yip said estimating the future number of GPUs is becoming complex as GPU technology becomes more efficient.

Yip also said Meta will invest in 1.5 gigawatts worth of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, to reduce its carbon footprint. All told, Meta will help finance “enough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of this data center,” she wrote in an email.

But it isn’t clear when those renewable projects will start. Entergy has filed for permission with the state utilities commission to build the natural gas plants, but not the renewable ones yet, Kirby said.

Meta also said on Tuesday that it is exploring using nuclear energy to power data centers, and asked companies in that field to submit proposals for nuclear reactors. Any reactors wouldn’t be available until well into the 2030s, however.

Meta is investing heavily in artificial intelligence and has been expanding the number of data centers it uses to process its AI applications. But even as the AI race accelerates, this Louisiana data center doesn’t look like it will be completed soon. The company said construction will “continue through 2030 with site work beginning in December.”

Shares of American Eagle plunge 13% as company issues weak holiday guidance,1h6rjgj,Puginator,2024-12-05 02:50:33,29,0.91,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h6rjgj/shares_of_american_eagle_plunge_13_as_company/,"American Eagle issued weak holiday guidance on Wednesday and cut its full-year forecast as it contends with value-seeking consumers who are only willing to spend during key shopping moments. 

The apparel retailer narrowly missed Wall Street’s expectations on the top line, but beat on the bottom line. 

Here’s how American Eagle performed during its third fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 48 cents adjusted vs. 46 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $1.29 billion vs. $1.30 billion expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $80 million, or 41 cents per share, compared with $96.7 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges related to restructuring and impairment costs, American Eagle posted an adjusted profit of 48 cents per share. 

Sales dropped to $1.29 billion, down about 1% from $1.3 billion a year earlier. 

While it was narrow, Wednesday’s miss is the third quarter in a row that American Eagle has not met Wall Street’s sales targets.

Shares dropped about 13% in extended trading.

In a statement, CEO Jay Schottenstein touted a “strong” back-to-school shopping season but said demand remains inconsistent in between major shopping events. 

“We have entered the holiday season well positioned, with our leading brands offering high-quality merchandise, great gifts and an outstanding shopping experience across channels,” Schottenstein said. “Key selling periods have seen a positive customer response, yet we remain cognizant of potential choppiness during non-peak periods.” 

Consumers coming out for key shopping moments, and then sharply dropping off, has been a consistent theme across the retail industry. Foot Locker cited a similar dynamic when reporting earnings earlier on Wednesday, as did Dollar Tree.

For its holiday quarter, American Eagle is expecting comparable sales to be up around 1% with total sales down about 4%, including an $85 million impact from having one less selling week and a later start to the holiday shopping season. The outlook is below the 2.2% comparable sales growth StreetAccount was looking for and the 1% sales decline LSEG had expected. 

As a result, American Eagle is now expecting comparable sales to grow by 3% for the full year, down from prior guidance of 4% growth and below StreetAccount’s estimate of 4.1%. It’s now expecting full-year sales to be up 1%, down from previous guidance of between 2% and 3% and below LSEG expectations of 2.5% growth. 

Similar to other retailers, American Eagle had taken a cautious approach to the back half of the year as it contended with uncertainty around the 2024 election and the overall macroeconomic environment. But unlike its competitors, it has kept that cautious tone.

Both Abercrombie & Fitch and Dick’s Sporting Goods, which issued cautious outlooks earlier this year, reversed their previous mood when reporting earnings earlier this month. 

Despite the underwhelming outlook and sales miss, American Eagle is seeing strong demand for its Aerie brand. Third-quarter revenue for Aerie came in at an all-time high for the company and comparable sales grew 5%, on top of 12% growth from the year-ago period.

ESPN hopes to reach more casual sports fans with Disney+ integration,1h6rden,Puginator,2024-12-05 02:43:37,3,0.56,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h6rden/espn_hopes_to_reach_more_casual_sports_fans_with/,"ESPN is coming to Disney+. Now, the sports network wants to make sure Disney+ users come to ESPN.

Walt Disney debuted a dedicated ESPN tile Wednesday on Disney+ for people who subscribe to ESPN+, its sports streaming platform, to watch programming without leaving the Disney+ application. Next fall, when ESPN launches its yet-to-be-named “flagship” service, those subscribers will get full access to all ESPN content through the ESPN tile on Disney+.

Disney is making about 100 live games available to Disney+ members without a corresponding ESPN subscription. Those events will span college football and basketball, the National Basketball Association and WNBA, the National Hockey League, Major League Baseball, tennis, golf, the Little League World Series, and UFC, ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said in an interview.

Next week’s alternate “Simpsons” telecast of the NFL’s “Monday Night Football” game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Dallas Cowboys will also be available to Disney+ subscribers, as well as five NBA Christmas games.

“Now when you subscribe to Disney+, you’ll have access to kids and family, general entertainment if you’re a Hulu subscriber, and sports,” said Pitaro. “Our goal is to serve sports fans anytime, anywhere.”

ESPN will also include some of its studio programming — such as “College Gameday,” “Pardon the Interruption” and certain podcasts that include video — on Disney+ for non-ESPN subscribers. Some ESPN sports-related films and documentaries will also appear on Disney+ married to whatever sports season is active, Pitaro said.

ESPN’s programming will also be integrated within the Disney+ search, similar to Hulu’s integration earlier this year. If a Disney+ subscriber who isn’t an ESPN customer clicks on something that requires an ESPN subscription, the user will be prompted to sign up within the app.

# New content for Disney+

ESPN is also creating two studio shows specifically for Disney+, Pitaro said. The first will be a daily “SportsCenter” just for Disney+ subscribers, which will air live on Disney+ at a set time and then remain on the platform for on-demand viewing.

The second is a women’s sports show that may air weekly or several times a week. Both programs are in development and will be made for a more casual sports fan, said Pitaro.

“Our research shows there’s very little overlap between people watching Disney+ and ESPN linear,” said Pitaro.

Disney+ has a strong female audience that Pitaro hopes will tune into the weekly’s women’s show, which he first alluded to in an interview with CNBC Sport in October.

ESPN+ has about 30,000 live games each year and costs $11.99 per month when purchased separately from Disney+. A Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle (with ads) costs $16.99 per month.

Rivian's sales were up 71% compared to Q1 2023. The company has been ramping up production, although it has faced some challenges due to supply chain issues. Rivian has adjusted its delivery targets for 2024 to between 50,500 and 52,000 vehicles.

I understand that they have been struggling to make a profit, which definitely cannot be overlooked. But, there is no denying that the demand is there. The backing is also there. Volkswagen has invested in Rivian. In 2024, Volkswagen announced an investment of up to $5 billion in Rivian, with the goal of developing next-generation electric vehicle architecture and software technology. The two companies formed a joint venture to collaborate on this project.

The stock has been sitting in the 10-15 dollar range the last 6 months. It seems to me that the market is waiting for it to break one way or another. If it breaks to the upside I could see a lot of people that have been waiting on the sidelines hop on board.

"Intel’s CEO shakeup puts foundry plans, CHIPS Act cash at risk",1h6pcon,JRshoe1997,2024-12-05 01:21:54,123,0.89,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h6pcon/intels_ceo_shakeup_puts_foundry_plans_chips_act/,"Intel (INTC) is in crisis. The company forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger on Monday, its stock price is down more than 50% on the year, and the grand plan to add third-party semiconductor manufacturing to its repertoire is suddenly more unclear than ever.

Gelsinger’s gambit to transform Intel into a US-based version of Taiwan’s TSMC that builds chips for its rivals is one of the reasons the company received $7.8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. But the foundry business, which it plans to operate as an independent subsidiary, has been hemorrhaging money and its biggest customer is still Intel itself.

Yes, the company has picked up deals to build chips for Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), but that hasn’t quelled calls for Intel to kill its third-party foundry plan. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in an investor note that Intel could go as far as fully separating its design and manufacturing businesses.

But ditching its fabs, or fabrication facilities, is a lot easier said than done, especially if Intel wants to hold on to those CHIPS Act funds.

“They just got the CHIPS Acts money. And if you look very closely at the details, it basically says that Intel cannot sell more than a controlling share of the manufacturing footprint,” explained Mario Morales, group vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC. “So that means that Intel will have to maintain manufacturing control of their capacity.”

In other words, there’s no easy path forward for the US’s largest homegrown chip builder.

The Commerce Department and Intel announced the chipmaker would be getting CHIPS Act funding just last week, with the DoC saying the cash would help Intel expand its manufacturing capacity in the US, a key part of Gelsinger’s plan to help the company compete with TSMC and Samsung, two of the largest chipmakers in the world.

Gelsinger initially unveiled the ambitious agenda, called IDM 2.0, or integrated device manufacturing 2.0, in 2021, the same year he took the reins as CEO. At the time, he said Intel would create a world-class foundry business. But Gelsinger took over an Intel beset by problems.

Lack of investment and missed opportunities over the years meant the company failed to catch the mobile wave and fell behind TSMC in design capabilities. And building out a global manufacturing footprint isn’t cheap, which, for a company that was already hurting, wasn’t ideal.

Gelsinger had four years to make the turnaround happen, and while Intel’s chip design process is catching up, building chip manufacturing facilities takes time, more than Intel’s board seemed interested in giving Gelsinger.

“Some of the problems that Intel had, and still has, are not things you can solve overnight. They are multiyear issues,” said TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell.

“Gelsinger started on a path to follow some of these things. And I think ultimately, at the highest level, what he chose to do, which is to get the manufacturing stuff back in shape and to work on design, is ultimately what the company needs to do.”

Now Intel has to make a decision: carry on with Gelsinger’s plan or cut back and focus on its own chip building capabilities or give up the business entirely. But doing that means saying goodbye to CHIPS Act money unless it can get approval from the Commerce Department

Under the terms of the CHIPS Act agreement, Intel is prohibited from certain change of control transactions. If the company spins off its foundry business, it has to hold on to at least 50.1% of the voting rights of the entity if it’s a private company. If the new entity goes public, a third party can’t own 35% or more of it. That means Intel can’t simply cut its foundry business loose and go fabless if it wants to hold on to that CHIPS money.

But moving forward with the foundry model could be difficult.

“I think as a combined entity it's hard to survive, because the biggest problem is your potential customers for foundry are all your competitors against Intel products,” explained Gartner analyst Gaurav Gupta. “So how would they have trust in Intel foundry and become its customers, right?”

If Intel does end up pulling back on its third-party manufacturing ambitions, however, it could end up eating a good portion of the losses.

“You'd have to scale back. You'd have to lay off people. I'm sure there would be some sunk cost, but the alternative is you keep losing billions of dollars a quarter,” Citi head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely told Yahoo Finance. “So, I think you just need to scrap it. Take your lumps. If you have to, return the money to the government.”

While Danely believes Intel should drop its goal of serving as a global foundry for other companies, he says it should continue to build its own chips.

“I still think they should manufacture their own CPUs,” he explained. ""There's been speculation for a long time that they're just going to turn the keys over to [TSMC] and have [TSMC] make everything. We don't think that that's the right move.”

Before that, however, Intel needs to find a new permanent CEO.

The last time Costco had a PE this high was right before the 2000's bubble, it lost 50% of its value over the next couple years. Is Costco still worth buying at a 60 PE ratio? Is Costco doing something different with their business model in 2024 that justifies the PE to almost double from the start of 2024? Are investors starting to get irrational in this market?

Amazon sued by DC attorney general for allegedly excluding neighborhoods from Prime delivery,1h6gi97,Puginator,2024-12-04 19:23:24,205,0.88,135,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h6gi97/amazon_sued_by_dc_attorney_general_for_allegedly/,"Washington, D.C.’s attorney general sued Amazon on Wednesday, accusing the company of covertly depriving residents in certain ZIP codes in the nation’s capital from access to Prime’s high-speed delivery.

The lawsuit from AG Brian Schwalb alleges that, since 2022, Amazon has “secretly excluded” two “historically underserved” D.C. ZIP codes from its expedited delivery service while charging Prime members living there the full subscription price. Amazon’s Prime membership program costs $139 a year and includes perks like two-day shipping and access to streaming content.

“Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide,” Schwalb said in a statement. “While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one zip code is worth less than a dollar in another.”

In June 2022, Amazon allegedly stopped using its own delivery trucks to shuttle packages in the ZIP codes 20019 and 20020 based on concerns over driver safety, the suit states. In place of its in-house delivery network, the company relied on outside carriers like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service to make deliveries, according to the complaint, which was filed in D.C. Superior Court.

The decision caused residents in those ZIP codes to experience “significantly longer delivery times than their neighbors in other District ZIP codes, despite paying the exact same membership price for Prime,” the lawsuit says.

Data from the AG shows that before Amazon instituted the change, more than 72% of Prime packages in the two ZIP codes were delivered within two days of checkout. That number dropped to as low as 24% following the move, while two-day delivery rates across the district increased to 74%.

Amazon has faced prior complaints of disparities in its Prime program. In 2016, the company said it would expand access to same-day delivery in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Washington, after a Bloomberg investigation found Black residents were “about half as likely” to be eligible for same-day delivery as white residents.

The ZIP codes in Schwalb’s complaint are in areas with large Black populations, according to 2022 Census data based on its American Community Survey.

The Federal Trade Commission also sued Amazon in June 2023, accusing the company of tricking consumers into signing up for Prime and “sabotaging” their attempts to cancel by employing so-called dark patterns, or deceptive design tactics meant to steer users toward a specific choice. Amazon said the complaint was “false on the facts and the law.” The case is set to go to trial in June 2025.

According to Scwalb’s complaint, Amazon never communicated the delivery exclusion to Prime members in the area. When consumers in the affected ZIP codes complained to Amazon about slower delivery speeds, the company said it was due to circumstances outside its control, the suit says.

The lawsuit accuses Amazon of violating the district’s consumer protection laws. It also asks the court to “put an end to Amazon’s deceptive conduct,” as well as for damages and penalties.

To get packages to customers’ doorsteps, Amazon uses a combination of its own contracted delivery companies, usually distinguishable by Amazon-branded cargo vans, as well as carriers like USPS, UPS and FedEx, and a network of gig workers who make deliveries from their own vehicles as part of its Flex program.

Amazon has rapidly expanded its in-house logistics army in recent years as it looks to speed up deliveries from two days to one day or even a few hours. In July, the company said it recorded its “fastest Prime delivery speeds ever” in the first half of the year, delivering more than 5 billion items within a day.

In relying on its own workforce, Amazon has assumed greater control over its delivery operations.

In his complaint, Schwalb cites an internal company policy that says Amazon may choose to exclude certain areas from being served by its in-house delivery network if a driver experiences “violence, intimidation or harassment.” The company relies on UPS or USPS to deliver packages in excluded areas.

"GM expects more than $5 billion impact from China restructuring, including plant closures",1h6ftzy,Puginator,2024-12-04 18:51:20,39,0.87,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h6ftzy/gm_expects_more_than_5_billion_impact_from_china/,"General Motors expects a restructuring of its joint venture operations with SAIC Motor Corp. in China to cost more than $5 billion in non-cash charges and writedowns, the Detroit automaker disclosed in a federal filing Wednesday morning.

GM said it expects to write down the value of its joint-venture operations in China by between $2.6 billion and $2.9 billion. It also anticipates another $2.7 billion in charges to restructure the business, including “plant closures and portfolio optimization,” according to the filing.

GM, which previously announced plans to restructure the operations in China, did not disclose any additional details about the expected closures.

“As we have consistently said, we are focused on capital efficiency and cost discipline and have been working with SGM to turn around the business in China in order to be sustainable and profitable in the market. We are close to finalizing our restructuring plan with our partner, and we expect our results in China in 2025 to show year-over-year improvement,” GM said in an emailed statement.

GM said it believes the joint venture “has the ability to restructure without new cash investments” from the American automaker.

A majority of the restructuring costs is expected to be recognized as non-cash, special item charges during the fourth quarter. That means they will impact the automaker’s net income, but not its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes – a key metric monitored by Wall Street.

GM’s operations in China have shifted from a profit engine to liability in the past decade as competition grows from government-backed domestic automakers fueled by nationalism, and as a generational shift in consumer perceptions of the automotive industry and electric vehicles takes hold.

Equity income from GM’s Chinese operations and joint ventures peaked at more than $2 billion in 2014 and 2015.

GM’s market share in China, including its joint ventures, has plummeted from roughly 15% as recently as 2015 to 8.6% last year — the first time it has dropped below 9% since 2003. GM’s equity income from the operations have also fallen, down 78.5% since peaking in 2014, according to regulatory filings.

GM’s U.S.-based brands such as Buick and Chevrolet have seen sales drop more than its joint venture sales with SAIC Motor, Wuling Motors and others. The joint venture models accounted for about 60% of its 2.1 million vehicles sold last year in China.

Prior to this year, the only quarterly losses for GM in China since 2009 were a $167 million shortfall during the first quarter of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and an $87 million loss during the second quarter of 2022.

The Detroit automaker has reported three consecutive quarterly losses in equity income for its Chinese operations this year, totaling $347 million. That includes a loss of $137 million during the third quarter.

I think this is the case for almost all of the companies I listed. If they aren’t flat out better, they offer something slightly different, or are better in a certain way. 

These smaller cap stocks are obviously a bigger risk, since a lot of them still are not making money, but the growth is very appealing. 

Would love to hear some comparisons like this and an explanation as to why you think the smaller company is better, or will continue to grow. 

Appreciate any responses! The stock market is a wonderful place for some competition.

Costco tariffs coming to a store near you! ,1h62nju,Euro347,2024-12-04 05:46:39,0,0.41,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h62nju/costco_tariffs_coming_to_a_store_near_you/,"I love Costco, the stores are awesome and they have everything but i feel the stock has gotten out of control.

The PE is 59! you are paying $59 for every $1 they earn. Thats just irresponsible investing.

They are expanding across Asia but they are also facing stiff competition from home base Chinese companies. And one thing china is very good at: copying everyone else and selling stuff for cheap to eliminate competition. Im not saying Costco will fail but it wont be easy for them outside the US.

Lastly we have the tariff situation. The proposition is a 10% tariff on Chinese goods and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. This is a bit of a problem because Costco is the #12 importer in the US for 2024. Most common origin is China. Walmart got smart and started to protect themselves and reducing Chinese imports but Costco and their business model, will have a much harder time navigating with keeping the prices attractive.

All their top trading partners are Chinese companies.

Costco sells ALOT of electronics and appliances, its one of their biggest categories. If a TV cost $1000 today, staring Jan 20th(day one in office) it will cost $1600. Appliances going up $100's of dollars is hyper inflation and people are already stretched thin going into the holidays.

Im really looking forward to this upcoming earnings release and how they will guide going forward. I guarantee you all the analyst questions will be about tariffs and profit margins.

Costco's profit margin for fiscal 2023 was 2.6%. Costco's profit margin for 2024 was 2.9%. They can only raise the membership and prices so much before people starting shopping elsewhere. ",2024-12-04,0.9662,Positive,"['PE', 'US', 'US', 'ALOT', 'TV']"
"""Existencial question"" about common stocks.",1h61ksu,skwex,2024-12-04 04:59:18,0,0.3,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h61ksu/existencial_question_about_common_stocks/,"Let's suppose that a few financial analysts have evaluated the intrinsic value of the shares of company X. By ""intrinsic"", I mean not only the value of the company underlying assets (tangible and intangible) minus liabilities but also any other type of fundamental analysis. By consensus, the intrinsic value was estimated at $1 per share.

However, the market value is $0.70. In other words, the stock is being sold at a discount. Is there any kind of arbitrage that forces the market price to converge towards the intrinsic value? I haven't yet found any reason that would encourage the increase in the market price beyond the usual speculation. Even if the stock has an intrinsic value of $1, shareholders cannot liquidate it outside the secondary market...

Arbitrage in derivatives markets is easier to understand. Suppose the market price of gold is M. To secure this price in the future, an investor can buy a gold call option at a price P (strike price), where M = P on the date of purchase of the option. After some time, the market price of gold is M+N. Consequently, the option has gained a value of N, that is: it can be sold directly for N to another investor. Even if there is no liquidity in the derivatives market to sell the option for N, the investor can exercise the right to buy gold for P and sell the gold in the spot market for M+N. From this exercise, he would obtain the same N.

In the equity market, I don't see a similar way for an investor to liquidate the intrinsic value of the stock. It doesn't make much sense either. So, there's only speculation left. If that's really the case, it's quite problematic. As a famous economist said: ""Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.""",2024-12-04,0.9814,Positive,[]
"Salesforce shares rise after earnings beat on revenue, fourth-quarter guidance",1h60pge,Puginator,2024-12-04 04:21:47,34,0.88,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h60pge/salesforce_shares_rise_after_earnings_beat_on/,"Salesforce shares were up 8% on Tuesday after the company reported its fiscal third-quarter earnings, reporting revenue and fiscal fourth-quarter guidance that exceeded analysts’ expectations.

Here is how the company did compared to what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.41 adjusted vs. $2.44 expected
* **Revenue:** $9.44 billion vs. $9.34 billion expected

The company’s revenue grew 8% year-over-year during the fiscal third quarter, which ended on Oct. 31. Its net income was $1.5 billion in the quarter, up 25% from $1.2 billion a year ago.

Salesforce said that it is expecting fiscal fourth-quarter sales to come in between $9.90 billion to $10.10 billion. Analysts were projecting $10.05 billion in fourth-quarter sales.

The company said that it expects an earnings per share between the range of $2.57 and $2.62 in the fourth-quarter, compared to analysts’ expectations of $2.65.

Salesforce also raised the low end of its revenue guidance for its fiscal 2025 to come between $37.8 billion and $38 billion. That’s up slightly from $37.7 billion to $38 billion previously. The new range puts the mid point for Salesforce’s fiscal 2025 revenue guidance at $37.9 billion, ahead of analysts’ expectations of $37.86 billion.

“We delivered another quarter of exceptional financial performance across revenue, margin, cash flow, and cRPO,” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a statement. “Agentforce, our complete AI system for enterprises built into the Salesforce Platform, is at the heart of a groundbreaking transformation.”

The company in August announced that CFO Amy Weaver would step down from her role as chief financial officer but remain in the position until the company appoints a successor, after which she will become an advisor. That same month, activist investor Starboard Value revealed that it boosted its position in Salesforce by roughly 40% in the second quarter following the firm issuing a letter earlier in the year saying that Salesforce was continuing to move “in the right direction” in regards to improving its profit margin.

Starboard Value released a presentation in October in which it noted that Salesforce “can continue to become more efficient and more profitable.”

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

GM to sell stake in battery cell plant to joint venture partner for roughly $1 billion,1h560u4,Puginator,2024-12-03 02:45:49,34,0.97,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h560u4/gm_to_sell_stake_in_battery_cell_plant_to_joint/,"General Motors plans to sell its stake in a $2.6 billion electric vehicle battery cell plant in Michigan to its joint venture partner LG Energy Solution, the automaker announced Monday.

The Detroit carmaker said it expects to recoup its investment in the facility, which a source familiar with the plans said is anticipated to be roughly $1 billion. The sale is part of a non-binding agreement between the two companies that’s anticipated to close during the first quarter of next year, GM said.

The nearly completed, 2.8 million-square-foot plant in Lansing, Michigan, was expected to be the third battery cell facility of the joint venture, known as Ultium Cells LLC, following plants in Ohio and Tennessee that have already opened and are operational.

The Lansing plant was announced in January 2022, and the two companies first announced their joint venture five years ago.

GM’s move comes as the automaker attempts to right-size production of electric vehicles and confronts slower-than-expected consumer demand. It also comes amid uncertainty regarding federal incentives for manufacturing and purchasing EVs in the U.S. under President-elect Donald Trump.

The automaker said the sale does not impact its overall ownership stake in the joint venture or its future plans for a separate joint venture plant with LGES rival Samsung SDI.

“We believe we have the right cell and manufacturing capabilities in place to grow with the EV market in a capital efficient manner,” GM CFO Paul Jacobson said in a release. “When completed, this transaction will also help LG Energy Solution meet demand by leveraging capacity that’s nearly ready to come online and it will make GM even more efficient.” 

GM said the South Korean battery supplier will have immediate access to the Lansing facility to begin installation of equipment. The plant, which currently employs nearly 100 people, was expected to begin operating by the end of this year.

Separate from the sale of its stake in the Lansing facility, GM on Monday announced it will extend a 14-year battery technology partnership with LGES to include the development of an emerging type of battery cell called prismatic cells.

Prismatic cells are a flat, rectangular shape with a rigid enclosure, which allows for space-efficient packaging within battery modules and packs. GM said the cells are expected to reduce EV weights and costs, while simplifying manufacturing by reducing the number of modules and mechanical components.

“We’re focused on optimizing our battery technology by developing the right battery chemistries and form factors to improve EV performance, enhance safety, and reduce costs. By extending our partnership with LG Energy Solution, we’re taking an important step towards these goals,” Kurt Kelty, GM vice president of battery cell and pack, said in a release.

What do we think about IOVA?,1h54hmj,Heg96,2024-12-03 01:43:23,0,0.44,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h54hmj/what_do_we_think_about_iova/,"Firstly congrats everyone on RKLB, ACHR and LUNR gains. It was fun ride, I have to be honest I had jumped off the wagon a bit earlier but hat off to all of you that mooned! 

Also for some of you that jumped on ZETA, enjoy the good days that await. 

But let’s talk about IOVA…:

Another biopharma stock trying to solve the issues of cancer. An industry that is a Holy Grail for all pump and dumpers out here. 

But is this one different? To be honest I do not know, but that is why I am posting this. To hear other sides, other points of view. 

IOVA is currently sitting around $9. These are levels of before the this year run to $16 (what goes up must come down, when pumped and dumped). However… this company reported revenues, 90.86mil revenue to be precise. Granted, not enough to support current market cap but bear in mind it is bio industry we talk about. It takes 1 approval and it is too late.

Leadership:
CEO is there since 2016, seems like an experienced guy. Was contributor to many oncology drugs already developed and approved.

Others seem legit as well, this post is already too long… feel free to research yourself.

They also own a bit less than 12% so there is certain commitment there.  And of course the vanguard, black rock etc. are heavily involved as well. More than 87% is owned by institutions. 

Amtagvi product got approved by FDA and that is now generating certain revenue. They plan tk get approval in Canada, Europe and UK as well. 

They also work on LN-145, IOV-4001 and IOV-3001 but let’s be honest these are long shots and nothing guarantee success of these.

I know these are speculations and putting some numbers from the future is no way to go but I feel like I have to just to make this post a bit more complete.

Potential yearly revenue if approved broader and if nothing goes wrong  is 12billion (amount of people with cancer of specific type * cost of treatment) but realistic values at beginning is 1-2bill per year or even less. 

And then for all the gamblers time that with moon if other drugs get approved as well. 

Company with 90mil revenue and 80 million of debt with 2,8 billion market cap and 440 million of operating expenses. Company with future (on the moon or in the sand). Do you hate IOVA or you will become a bag holder?

Super Micro Computer pops 15% after special committee finds no ‘evidence of misconduct’,1h4xtvz,Puginator,2024-12-02 21:12:02,225,0.94,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h4xtvz/super_micro_computer_pops_15_after_special/,"Super Micro Computer surged more than 14% after a special committee ruled that it found “no evidence of misconduct” at the embattled AI server maker, and appointed a new chief accounting officer.

“The evidence reviewed by the Special Committee did not raise any substantial concerns about the integrity of Supermicro’s senior management or Audit Committee, or their commitment to ensuring that the Company’s financial statements are materially accurate,” the company said in a release.

Super Micro said it’s also currently searching for a new chief financial officer, and looking to fill additional financial leadership positions. The company appointed current Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller Kenneth Cheung as its chief accounting officer.

The news from Super Micro Computer comes on the heels of a volatile year for the company. Shares sank in August after Hindenburg Research revealed a short position in the company, saying that it found “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation” and the company delayed the release of its annual filing.

Those troubles continued, with Ernst & Young resigning as the company’s auditor in October due to concerns about the board’s governance and independence. Shares are up about 30% this year, after giving back much of its rally. Last month, the company averted a potential delisting from the Nasdaq following its monster plunge.

Among the findings, the committee ruled that the conclusions reached by Ernst & Young in its resignation were “not supported by the facts” and that the firm’s audit committee exhibited “appropriate independence and generally provided proper oversight.”

The special committee consisted of Super Micro’s board, counsel from Cooley LLP and a team from forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors.

Custom AI chips are at the core of Broadcom is AI revenues, accounting for up to two-thirds of the total, driven primarily through partnerships with hyperscalers such as Microsoft, AWS, and Google.

Customized chips are expected to play a more important role over the next five years, helping customers address AI cluster scaling and cost challenges.

Broadcom is leadership in the networking market could be challenged by NVIDIA, which is capturing the market with more competitive networking solutions.

Broadcom is growth in AI, while promising, is still a low percentage of overall revenue from AI.

Weakness in the non-AI revenue segment could undermine the market's bullish confidence in Broadcom.

Wall Street is constructive on Broadcom, but future guidance needs to remain strong to maintain market confidence.

Broadcom is forward-looking PEG ratio of 1.69 is attractive compared to the tech sector average of 1.89.

I think attention needs to be paid to the company's execution in AI and potential headwinds in non-AI businesses.

On balance, Broadcom stock is under short-term pressure, but the long-term bullish logic remains in place for investors who are optimistic about AI growth prospects.

Its possible the Dept of Justice might sue them to pay back their, corrupt pricing over the years.

The other factor is Jan 20th inauguration day. Trump clearly said he's not paying a dollar more to Ukraine, so that means billions of dollars is no longer going to flow to the bottom line.

Anyone else buying the NU dip?,1h4wyxh,Far_Version9387,2024-12-02 20:34:37,32,0.73,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h4wyxh/anyone_else_buying_the_nu_dip/,"I’ve been an investor in NU for a while now. I firmly believe the market is panic selling because Warren Buffet sold 19% of his stake in the company.

Today the company is down again because Citi bank downgraded its rating on NU to a sell.

Why do people care that Citi bank downgraded to a sell? It’s literally a bank that could potentially have to rival NU soon if they break into USA markets. Citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing, amazing company.

If anything, the downgrade should be seen as a good sign. It shows that american banks like Citi are starting to feel a bit of pressure from how fast NU has been able to expand its user base.

I know Brazil has made changes to its financial regulations. However, NU is rapidly expanding its user base to other countries. Plus, Brazils projected annual GDP growth per year is very good.

Do you guys agree?

EDIT:

(Thanks for all your thoughts. I’ve realized there are a few key things I overlooked.

I previously thought the stock was heavily owned by retail investors, similar to SoFi’s stock. I naively assumed this because the stock is frequently discussed on social media. Due to this preconceived notion, I believed the stock price would be significantly influenced by analyst ratings. I still think a large number of people have started to sell because of Warren Buffett reducing his stake and Citi’s sell recommendation. However, I now see that the primary factors driving this downturn are geopolitical and economic risks in Brazil.

My updated assessment is that the stock is being sold for a few very valid reasons. Firstly, Brazil’s inflation has been rising over the past few quarters. Secondly, Donald Trump has threatened BRICS nations with 100% tariffs if they decide to create a currency to rival the U.S. dollar. Thirdly, Warren Buffett sold 19% of his stake in the company. Fourthly, the value of Brazil’s currency has been declining and recently hit historic lows compared to the U.S. dollar. Finally, Brazil’s government spending was recently cut, potentially signaling a slowdown in their economy.

Overall, people are very concerned about the economic and geopolitical risks surrounding NU, especially since it is a Brazilian company. Brazil has a historically unstable economy and is currently facing economic headwinds that are amplified by the risk of potential tariffs.

I’m taking a cautious approach from here on out. I won’t be selling any shares, but I also won’t be buying more until the stock price consolidates and the Brazilian economy stabilizes.

I’m still very bullish on NU because the company has grown unbelievably fast in just 11 years. They survived Brazil’s economic collapse in 2014–2016, and they also weathered the last round of U.S. tariffs on Brazil in 2018. I believe NU will continue to expand rapidly into other Latin American countries, which will reduce its exposure to Brazilian tariffs and economic challenges. The CEO and management team are extremely competent, and I believe in their ability to navigate these challenges in the long term.

The worst-case scenario would be if the BRICS nations successfully create a new currency. Even then, I still believe NU will be okay due to its expansion into other markets. For now, I’m holding and remain very bullish on the business.)",2024-12-02,0.9743,Positive,"['NU', 'NU', 'NU', 'USA', 'NU', 'NU', 'GDP', 'EDIT', 'BRICS', 'NU', 'NU', 'NU', 'CEO', 'BRICS', 'NU']"

I’ll give an example that pertains to me. I’m currently invested in Sofi, PLTR, and RKLB, so this has been an incredible year for me. But looking back, it’s starting to really feel like total and utter exuberance again like 2021. YouTube videos and subreddits have been saying over and over how this is only the beginning and we’re going to be at 500 next year. That’s exactly the type of shit that was said in 2021 right before every small cap stock tanked like 70%. 

I’m not saying it’s a time to sell, I would personally prescribe to the “it’s time to slow down on how much I invest” currently. Buying RKlb at 27$ or PLTR at 66$ is not the same opportunity as in the 4-7$ range as it used to be. It seems very difficult to find any good deals, considering literally almost every sector in the stock market is just going up vertically. And just remember, just it is a great company doesn’t always mean it’s currently a good price to buy it. Sometimes it’s good to take the foot off the breaks when stocks going up 300%+ in one year.

But my confusion arises from the recent demand to split Google (example selling chrome or android). I understand this antitrust cases keep happening like i think it happened to Microsoft some years ago. But can't google sell its parts to a friend and still have continued access to whatever is needed.

For example, Musk seems to use X data to train models of xAI even if they are separate companies or uses Tesla employees to fix X stuff or spaceX stuff, it doesn't seem like the government stops companies from collaborating.

So here I am today, checking German market and specifically Volkswagen and I cannot figure out why is it so much undervalued. I mean look at this EBITDA and cash on hand.

With only about 5% of the ocean explored, there are so many unknowns and promising possibilities. 

Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and underwater drones is an emerging technology that I have been keeping a close eye on. This technology will make things like resource exploration, climate change research, scientific research, technological advancements and marine conservation more feasible. The are key factors that will drive growth in this sector the next 5-10 years. 

Currently there are a lot of ocean exploration companies that already have solid revenue streams from oil and gas industries and underwater infrastructure like pipelines and umbilicals. I think these current revenue streams will continue to thrive. And future revenue streams are right around the corner. 

Costs of exploration have been the biggest hurdle in this sector, but as technology continues to advance, costs have been quickly dwindling, making more and more projects feasible. 

Companies that I have recently been researching are: OII and TDY. Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts on these companies, and am excited to hear about other companies you find promising in this sector.

The evolution of an investor - Which level are you?,1h38kyf,k_ristovski,2024-11-30 14:24:48,0,0.47,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h38kyf/the_evolution_of_an_investor_which_level_are_you/,"I believe there’s a common journey (or evaluation) of an investor. We all start by knowing absolutely nothing about analyzing companies or investing in general, but we get better over time, as we accumulate knowledge and experience.

**Level 1: The Noob**

At this level, the focus is solely on the **share price and its past performance**. So, when the share price goes down from $100 to $30, the noob investor would conclude that now, the stock is cheap and buying is the right thing to do. Of course, this doesn’t have to be the case. In fact, public companies that went bankrupt went on exactly this trajectory. There are plenty of reasons why the share price could collapse, and this decline could be justified. However, the noob investor isn’t aware that there are many questions that one should ask.

In addition, at this level, there’s a **tendency to follow the crowd and the opinion of others**, which is often times a really bad idea. However, without any knowledge and experience, the opinions of others oftentimes sound logical and smart.

**Level 2: The Enthusiast**

The enthusiast has heard that **there’s more to investing than just the share price**. You’ve started exploring financial statements, and you’re learning the basics of accounting. **For the first time, the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement start making sense**. I’m sure everyone can recall that time when you could read the financial statements and understand what they meant. It comes with a confidence boost, and it is normal to think “*Ah, I’ve got this investing thing figured out. It’s easy!*”

The catch is – even though it feels like a superpower, this is still the beginning. Financial statements provide information about what happened, not what will happen. Understanding them is useful, but not enough to be a great investor.

But at least now, you can actually challenge some of the opinions of others.

**Level 3: The Seeker**

This is where one is moving beyond the basics. Now you’ve learned that there are **various valuation techniques**, that allow you to figure out what a company is worth. It gets exciting! This is where you get introduced to the EBITDA and P/E multiples, relative valuation, dividend discount model, and DCF. All of these can be powerful tools, and they’re one piece of the puzzle to understand if a company is undervalued or not. At some point, you will likely stick with one or two models that work best for you.

But here’s the problem. Having the tools isn’t the same as knowing how to use them. At this stage, it is common to have fancy spreadsheets with inputs that aren’t supported in any meaningful way other than historical financial data. Basically, **garbage in – garbage out**. You might not be aware of the disadvantages that come with the various models and fall into some of the common traps.

However, it doesn’t feel that way. When you spend hours gathering data and filling in your inputs, **it feels like a new superpower**, because in the end, there is an output. You have estimated the value of a company, and now you can compare that with the market price.

But, if your assumptions about growth rates, the discount rate, or margins are significantly off, your valuation is meaningless. In fact, there’s a chance it harms you more than it helps you.

By the way, everything that I’ve mentioned until now can be 100% automated. So, up until this level, you have no advantage over a relatively simple algorithm.

**Level 4: The Thinker**

At this point, you understand how important the inputs are.

Therefore, the focus shifts a bit more towards **understanding the industry, and the broader environment**, and asking the right questions so that the input is more solid.

For example, if you are analyzing a car company, you might want to understand if there’s a trend regarding EVs, if there are any regulatory changes that will impact your margins, if the company needs to invest more to expand its capacity, etc.

This is when **research becomes your best friend**. You’re no longer just looking at the company in isolation—you’re connecting the dots between the company, its competitors, and the broader environment. Storytelling also becomes a part of your process, as now you’re not just crunching numbers—you’re building a narrative about the company’s future.

**Level 5: The Pro**

This is the pinnacle of investing and where intangibles come into play.

I don’t mean goodwill and patents. I mean **the management team and the company’s culture**. The key questions here are:

* Is the management trustworthy?
* What is its track record?
* What is its vision?
* Is there a culture that can survive tough times?

Culture is an often-overlooked factor in investing, but it’s incredibly important. As the saying goes, 'Culture eats strategy for breakfast.' A company with a strong culture can attract and retain top talent which is a must for being a great company.

What I find interesting is, that if you are to invest in a private company, you’d get to level 5 sooner than if you invest in public companies.

Here’s an example. Imagine someone walks up to you, and offers you to invest $10k in his company, and in exchange, you’ll have 10% of it. The first question that you’ll have is: Who is this person? If the person in question was someone you know for bad behavior, misleading friends and family, and many failed ventures, you probably have your answer already, and the idea is irrelevant.

However, if it was someone you knew who has integrity and many successful ventures, then you’d probably continue the conversation by asking questions about the idea itself. Your goal would be to understand the business, whether it can survive in the environment, and what return can you expect from it.

Fellow Canadians: What’s the Difference Between ZSP and VFV?,1h2wlob,stanxv,2024-11-30 03:10:27,12,0.77,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h2wlob/fellow_canadians_whats_the_difference_between_zsp/,"I’ve been looking into Canadian ETFs and came across ZSP (BMO S&P 500 Index ETF) and VFV (Vanguard S&P 500 Index ETF). Both track the S&P 500, which is appealing to me because I want exposure to the U.S. market, but I’m trying to understand the differences between these two funds in more depth.

On the surface, they look very similar: both are Canadian-domiciled ETFs that hold U.S. equities and are traded on the TSX. They both offer exposure to the same underlying index, so their holdings should be nearly identical. However, I noticed a few potential areas where they might differ:

**MER (Management Expense Ratio)**: ZSP and VFV have slightly different MERs. Does the lower MER really make a noticeable difference over the long term, or is it more of a ""nice to have""?

**Tracking Error**: Are there any known differences in how closely these funds track the S&P 500? Are there any instances where one deviated more significantly than the other?

**Liquidity and Trading Spreads**: For someone who might not be buying or selling huge quantities, are there noticeable differences in the bid-ask spreads? Do they trade with similar liquidity, or does one tend to have an advantage?

**Currency Hedging**: From what I understand, neither of these funds is hedged to CAD. Is there any other nuance to their handling of currency that I should be aware of?

**Dividend Treatment**: Both distribute dividends, but does one reinvest them differently or handle U.S. withholding tax in a way that might make it more or less tax-efficient?

**Historical Performance**: Have you noticed any meaningful differences in performance between these two over the years? Even if minor, what could explain the difference if the index they track is identical?

Lastly, I’d love to hear what you personally use and why. Are there specific scenarios where ZSP might be better than VFV or vice versa? Is it purely a matter of brand loyalty (Vanguard vs. BMO), or are there more practical considerations?

I'm also curious about how either fits into a broader portfolio. If you’re holding one of these, are you pairing it with other U.S. exposure like QQQ, or do you lean heavily on Canadian equities like VCN for balance?

Any insights, opinions, or anecdotes would be super helpful! Thanks in advance for helping me make sense of these two ETFs.",2024-11-30,0.9942,Positive,"['ZSP', 'BMO', 'ETF', 'VFV', 'ETF', 'TSX', 'MER', 'ZSP', 'VFV', 'MER', 'CAD', 'ZSP', 'VFV', 'BMO', 'QQQ', 'VCN']"

NO ONE knows what the market will do other than it will go up, down or sideways.

But I feel like we live in a different world now than we did the past numerous decades. Everyone has access to investing. Right in the palm of their hands. Virtually anyone anywhere can invest in any market they wish from their phone. Historical returns are 7 percent (inflation adjusted) based on old technology, processes, access and education on finance. It is no longer the days of old where tie wearing NYSE brokers answer their rotary phones screaming about deals and brokering deals for end user. It was a whole process and really, you NEEDED someone to strike the deals for you and in most cases, suggest what funds to invest in since there was no internet to self educate or even research companies to invest in.

Nowadays with giants like Fidelity, Vanguard and others offering index funds that take all of the thought and most of the choice and a lot of the risk out of the equation. I don't need to ask a broker which SP500 fund to buy. I don't need a broker to strike deals for me. I don't even need to make a call or have a person do ANYTHING for me.

I am not a crypto investor, I am a naysayer in fact. But I cannot deny the effect that crypto has had on investing. It has done a LOT to make investing mainstream, if not even trendy. There were always hedge funds and major investors but now regular consumers are taking part and making retail a MUCH bigger player. Retail tripled almost instantly in 2020 and participation has remained high.

Almost all of the hurdles have been removed between the investor and the investment with technology. There is little to understand/learn and is done anywhere, any time for convenience. Not a fan of robinhood but apps like this have put the keys to investing directly into the end users hands.

Now that investing is automatically diversified, exceptionally well returning index funds are in the palm of everyone's hand, consider that the US stock market is the economic powerhouse of the world. Anyone anywhere for the most part can invest in US stock market. This is appealing to anyone in a lesser financial climate (Japan). Now that the wealth gluttons have their claws in every last corner of US government, I don't see them doing anything but moves to further bolster financial and economic markets. The US stock market is the harvesting field of the elite wealth gluttons.

My personal thoughts though as I said, I am aware NO ONE can predict the stock market. But it feels poised to redefine ""average returns"" and with the near future political climate.....if it doesn't get completely blown up (unlikely) I think future returns will far exceed 7 percent as long as the USA remains the economic powerhouse that it is",2024-11-29,0.9311,Positive,"['NO', 'ONE', 'NYSE', 'LOT', 'MUCH', 'US', 'US', 'US', 'US', 'NO', 'ONE', 'USA']"

I usually allocate the same amount of money to S&P 500 every month and have done this for years. However given much the stock market is up (27% YTD), especially including the recent trump mania, I think we are due a pull back.

And the way Buffet has been selling stocks recently, so does he. However would spending the same amount this month on Berkshire Hathaway stock instead of S&P, as a one off, hedge against this risk. 

WB has the highest stock pile he’s ever had, whilst still in the market albeit much smaller. I was just thinking it as a way of further diversification - I’ll obviously keep all of my investments in the S&P but as a one off for this month was thinking it could be wise to load up on BH stock, so can receive the benefits of the business of interest from their cash holdings as well as their equity holdings.

Why I think UBER is a BUY,1h2kshj,GrayBRZ,2024-11-29 18:02:18,0,0.3,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h2kshj/why_i_think_uber_is_a_buy/,"**Personal trading context:**

I do not look at balance sheets ever. I invest in companies that are undervalued due to bad publicity and not bad product. This year when CrowdStrike dipped from $390 to $217 I immediately took a position because I knew it was because of panic and not because the company's products are losing inherent value. I did the same for Meta during the whole VR panic and Tesla earlier this year. All of which dipped and are now up by more than 100%. Stock prices are determined by emotional sentiment so analyzing balance sheets are a waste of time to me.

**About Uber:**

I don't know anything about Uber's debts or profits, but I do know they are deviously good at getting around regulations and have completely pitted customers and drivers against each other. Recently I saw a post saying how Uber is sorry that they will now only allow drivers hired by agencies to drive instead of individual contractors in some European region. Do you think Uber is *really* sorry? This sounds like the government is getting involved and constricting Uber but I'm going to tell you why these things don't even matter.

Recently in my area the government passed regulations making Uber pay a minimum of $20.88/hr. You'd assume this will cut into Uber's profits but they got around it and drivers are not actually getting any of that money. What's crazy is that they're now pocketing more money from customers due to this change. I went into detail in another post which is important for you to read to help fully comprehend my view: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new\_uber\_2088\_minimum\_pay\_is\_not\_what\_you\_think/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new_uber_2088_minimum_pay_is_not_what_you_think/)

After going through that link you *should* understand that on the surface it seems like drivers will benefit from a minimum pay but they're actually earning less and customers are paying more. This is where I'm dumbfounded because even though I pointed out that Uber is deceiving it's customers and charging them a bogus ""service fee"", instead of getting mad at Uber they're getting mad at me for insinuating that drivers should get paid more. I thought I was doing a good thing by informing people how the new ""service fee"" they're paying to cover the driver minimums are actually getting pocketed by Uber, but nobody seems to care and instead enjoys the fact that drivers are not getting paid more money. I've been getting posts in my feed from r/tipping recently and they're pretty much all complaints against restaurants, drivers, and overall tipping culture. I also constantly get posts from drivers complaining about customers on r/UberEatsDrivers. Customers don't want to tip and are ignorant about how the job works. They hate drivers. Drivers make less money and hate customers as a result. Both sides have been completely brain washed and pitted against each other when the real enemy is actually Uber themselves. This is amazing for investors.

I love how Uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money. If you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying Uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them. Customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them. If you like A.I. this makes Uber a great alternative to buying straight NVDA or TSLA. They don't give a shit about you or me. Only revenue, but they're damn good at hiding that from their customers and drivers. I fucking love it. If you're going to spend money on Uber, spend it on shares.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Could Coinbase enter the S&P 500 in the Dec Rebalance?

(COIN) has demonstrated significant growth, meeting several key benchmarks considered by the S&P 500 Index Committee. However, its performance is closely tied to the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin. This correlation is evident, as Coinbase's stock price often mirrors Bitcoin's fluctuations. For instance, during bullish Bitcoin trends, Coinbase experiences increased trading volumes and revenues, leading to higher stock valuations. Out off all the likely companies [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) is in my top 3 for inclusion this Rebalance.  
  
The forthcoming S&P 500 rebalance will indeed be indicative of the Index Committee's perspective on integrating companies like Coinbase, which are deeply embedded in the cryptocurrency sector. Inclusion of such a company would signal a significant shift towards embracing the evolving financial landscape and acknowledging the growing prominence of digital assets. Conversely, opting not to include Coinbase might suggest a more cautious approach, reflecting concerns about the inherent volatility and regulatory uncertainties associated with the crypto market. Therefore, the committee's decision will not only impact Coinbase but also serve as a broader statement on the acceptance of digital asset platforms within traditional financial indices.

[TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/fiO01sTb-Dynamic-Relationship-Between-Bitcoin-and-Coinbase/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The S&P 500 Index Committee employs specific criteria for inclusion, such as market capitalisation, liquidity, domicile, public float, and financial viability. While Coinbase may satisfy these quantitative measures, the committee also exercises qualitative judgment, considering factors like market stability and the company's role within its industry.

[Corporate Finance Institute](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Given Coinbase's substantial exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency market, the committee might deliberate on the potential risks associated with such volatility. The decision to include a company so intertwined with the crypto sector would reflect the committee's stance on the evolving financial landscape and its readiness to integrate digital asset platforms into traditional indices.

In summary, while Coinbase appears to meet the fundamental requirements for S&P 500 inclusion, its strong correlation with Bitcoin introduces considerations that the committee will likely scrutinise, balancing traditional financial principles with the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market.",2024-11-28,0.9851,Positive,['COIN']
I think bird flu risk is being underestimated by the market. Long on $MRNA,1h1yuwt,is112358,2024-11-28 21:20:14,218,0.68,156,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h1yuwt/i_think_bird_flu_risk_is_being_underestimated_by/,"So far H5N1 has been slowly making it’s way from chickens to cows (around the middle of 2024) and now pigs in Oregon (within the last couple weeks). There have been a few mild human cases, basically all in farm workers working closely with infected animals. Although there was at least one case recently where they had no idea where the patient got infected from.

Normally, CDC will be tracking all this and keeping tabs on isolation of infected communities/individuals. This flu seems to be most prevalent in the US than other countries so far, and we have much more transparency and observability than China. So my risk assessment for this has been pretty low until Trump got elected.

But Trump has been making it very very clear that he’s going to pull every stop to deport undocumented migrants. Most of the people working in shitty conditions in farms are…undocumented. Undocumented workers are normally able to access some level of public services like healthcare, but this is about to get completely shut down by the Trump admin. And these farm workers are about to get shoved into concentrated compartments with really poor hygiene conditions, and it’s going to take a long time for them to actually get processed and deported. Many will run and hide, and that will also end up hiding how many people are actually infected and spreading the disease.

I think most people are expecting the Trump admin, especially under RFK Jr.'s health dept, to reduce spending on vaccines. But I think at a certain point, the rhetoric is bound to change, as more and more people get bird flu. After all, Operation Warp Speed was under the last Trump administration as well.

Moderna was given $176 million in July by the HHS to develop an mRNA bird flu vaccine. There already exists a bird flu vaccine made by CSL Seqirus, but I would imagine that the Trump administration will want to call upon a well-known American company to manufacture ""America first"" vaccines.

Reddit overtakes X in popularity of social media platforms in UK $RDDT,1h1x2aj,caollero,2024-11-28 19:55:22,1060,0.88,164,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h1x2aj/reddit_overtakes_x_in_popularity_of_social_media/,"[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk)

Reddit, the American online discussion platform, has overtaken X to become the fifth most popular social media platform in the UK, according to the communications watchdog.

Ofcom said Reddit, where users post on discussion threads within topic-based communities, was visited by 22.9 million UK adults in May this year, compared with 22.1 million on X.

The figures make Reddit the fastest-growing large social media platform in the UK and represent a growth of 47% on the same period in 2023. The leap took Reddit above LinkedIn and X into fifth place on the table of UK social media platforms, which is now topped by YouTube after it overtook [Facebook](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook), reaching more than 44 million adults.

Reddit, renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as Redditors, appears to have been boosted by updates to Google’s search engine this year.

Farhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, said: “Google’s latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave Reddit a big boost in organic search traffic. I think that has probably contributed a lot.”

Ofcom also speculated that the change may have been caused [by alterations to how third-party apps accessed its content](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/reddit-moderators-vow-to-continue-blackout-in-api-access-fees-row), forcing users of those apps to switch to the Reddit site. The watchdog also flagged publicity around Reddit’s stock market flotation in March this year.

The popularity of X also fell over the same period, according to Ofcom, with its reach falling by 8% since May last year. X has been criticised over content moderation standards since its [takeover by Elon Musk in 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal) but it has also faced competition since July 2023 from Threads, a rival to X [launched by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/06/meta-launches-twitter-rival-threads-in-100-countries).

The Ofcom figures featured in the watchdog’s annual report into the nation’s digital habits, which revealed that four out of 10 UK adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes, with the majority of those cases occurring online.

The misinformation survey, based on a poll of more than 4,000 UK adults, also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together, with the same number believing there is “significant evidence” of electoral fraud in the UK.

The regulator also found that one-third of UK adults are not confident in judging whether an image or a piece of audio or video has been created by artificial intelligence.",2024-11-28,-0.0247,Neutral,"['UK', 'UK', 'UK', 'UK', 'UK', 'UK', 'UK', 'UK', 'UK']"
PayPal: A Path Back to Its Historical Strength and Growth Potential,1h1tt6z,cmzer123,2024-11-28 16:47:34,36,0.69,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h1tt6z/paypal_a_path_back_to_its_historical_strength_and/,"PayPal, once a darling of the fintech space, has seen its valuation contract significantly over the past few years. With its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently hovering around 20, the stock is far below its historical average of 43. A return to that average, driven by projected earnings of $5.71 per share by 2025, would imply a stock price north of $246—an opportunity that many investors might be overlooking. But for PayPal to reclaim its historical valuation, much must fall into place.

The foundation of PayPal’s future lies in its strategic initiatives, beginning with the integration of its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD). Introduced in 2023, PYUSD is more than just another digital currency; it is PayPal’s bridge to the future of blockchain-powered commerce. Unlike many failed stablecoin experiments, PYUSD is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits and Treasuries, giving it the stability and trustworthiness needed to thrive. The potential for PYUSD to facilitate global cross-border payments and power decentralized finance (DeFi) applications is immense. PayPal’s ability to capitalize on this innovation could redefine its relevance in the financial ecosystem.

Beyond cryptocurrency, PayPal is making waves with a growing advertising business that has largely flown under the radar. By leveraging its immense trove of transactional data from over 400 million active users, the company is building a platform that allows merchants to create highly targeted and effective marketing campaigns. This advertising arm, though still in its early stages, has the potential to generate billions in annual revenue. Even modest success here could have a significant impact on PayPal’s top line, creating another compelling growth driver.

Innovation has always been at the heart of PayPal’s strategy, and recent developments like the Fastlane checkout system showcase its commitment to staying ahead. This one-click guest checkout feature, paired with partnerships with major platforms like Shopify and Fiserv, enhances the company’s offerings for merchants and consumers alike. Meanwhile, initiatives like the CashPass rewards program deepen user engagement and loyalty, ensuring that PayPal remains a go-to solution for everyday transactions.

Leadership will play a critical role in PayPal’s resurgence, and newly appointed CEO Alex Chriss appears well-suited for the task. With a proven track record at Intuit, Chriss has demonstrated his ability to foster innovation and deliver results. His focus on empowering small businesses aligns perfectly with PayPal’s strengths and provides a roadmap for future growth.

But the journey back to a P/E of 43 will require more than just strategic initiatives and innovation. PayPal needs to rebuild investor confidence. The company must consistently deliver strong earnings, improve operational efficiencies, and effectively communicate its vision to the market. Transparent updates on key growth areas—such as PYUSD adoption, advertising revenue, and merchant partnerships—will be crucial in shaping the market’s perception of PayPal’s potential.

A return to PayPal’s historical valuation isn’t just about numbers; it’s about the story the company tells and the trust it rebuilds with investors. If PayPal can execute on its strategy, the potential reward is not just a higher stock price but a reaffirmation of its position as a leader in the fintech space. For those willing to look beyond the current market sentiment, PayPal’s path to $246 offers a compelling narrative of transformation, growth, and untapped opportunity.

TL;DR: PayPal is undervalued at a P/E of 20 compared to its historical average of 43. To return to its peak valuation, it must capitalize on its stablecoin (PYUSD), grow its new advertising business, and leverage innovative products like Fastlane Checkout. Under CEO Alex Chriss, with strategic execution and strong earnings, PayPal could see a stock price of $246 by 2025, reaffirming its leadership in fintech.

Microsoft faces wide-ranging U.S. antitrust probe,1h1kqio,Puginator,2024-11-28 07:08:14,186,0.95,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h1kqio/microsoft_faces_wideranging_us_antitrust_probe/,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.  
  
The FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month.  
  
The FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.

Microsoft declined to comment on Wednesday.  
  
The FTC fielded complaints about Microsoft last year as it examined the cloud computing market.

NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft’s licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.

“Given that Microsoft is the world’s largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,” the group said.  
The FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.  
  
Until now, Microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators’ recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies.  
  
Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.  
  
Alphabet’s Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.  
  
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google’s trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.  
  
It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.  
  
Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.  
  
In 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.

That said, I’m always looking to improve, and I’m wondering if integrating technical analysis into my approach could help me refine my strategy further. I usually hold my positions for a few days to a few weeks. I have a few questions:
	
1.	Which technical indicators would you recommend for someone trading on a short to medium term basis and reacting to news-driven moves?
	
2.	Are there specific timeframes or chart setups that work better for trades lasting days or weeks? 
	
3.	Are there any books, courses, or resources you’d recommend for learning technical analysis, especially for high-volatility setups?
	
4.	How do you handle risk management when trading in such volatile environments?

5.   How can I identify which stocks are likely to have the highest trading volume or volatility during the day ?

I know there’s no one size fits all solution, but I believe combining fundamental insights with technical analysis could help me make better informed decisions.

Deep dive into Kering - From Timber to Gucci: A Legacy of Acquisitions,1h117vj,k_ristovski,2024-11-27 15:50:49,27,0.88,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h117vj/deep_dive_into_kering_from_timber_to_gucci_a/,"**1.0 Introduction**

Let’s start with a fun fact. Kering, the company that owns brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen, started as a **timber-trading company**.

Although it started back in 1962 and operated in a different industry, its DNA and management style haven’t changed much.

As I’m writing this, its share price is **down over 70%** from its peak back in August 2021 that was elevated due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

  
**2.0 The journey from timber to luxury**

***2.1 The timber period (1962 - 1988)***

The company was founded in France by François Pinault back in 1962 with a 100,000 francs loan from the bank. The business grew rapidly by **acquiring** many failing local timber traders in France, especially in the 1980s. By 1988, it owned 180 companies and 33 factories.

***2.2 The switch from timber to retail to luxury (1988 - 2013 - present)***

In 1988, it was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started:

* It merged with CFAO (A French distribution conglomerate)
* Acquired Conforama (French furniture retailer)
* Acquired Printemps (Department stores)
* Acquired 54% of La Redoute (French mail-order shopping retailer)
* Acquired Finac (French bookstore, multimedia, and electronics retailer)

The transformation from retail to luxury started in 1999 when it acquired 42% of **Gucci Group,** 100% of **Boucheron,** and 100% of **Yves Saint Laurent.** Today, Gucci accounts for 47% of its revenue.

François-Henri Pinault, the son of the founder François Pinault, became general manager of the company in 2003, and CEO in 2005. Under his leadership, the acquisitions in the luxury space continued.

It is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions (Conforama, Le Printemps, CFAO, and Fnac).

Its portfolio is quite diversified and includes:

* High-end clothing
* Footwear
* Handbags and leather goods
* Sunglasses and eyewear
* Scarves & other fashion accessories
* Jewelry
* Fragrances (due to the Creed acquisition)
* Cosmetics (in early stage)
* Watches

It is also geographically diversified:

* **APAC (excl. Japan)**: 32% of revenue
* **Western Europe**: 28% of revenue
* **North America**: 23% of revenue
* **Japan**: 8% of revenue
* **Rest of the World**: 9% of revenue

**3.0 Historical financial performance**

Its revenue increased from €15.9 billion in 2019, to €20.4 billion in 2022, and has contracted back to €18.4 billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic. 

Kering’s gross margin is stable at \~75%, meaning the direct costs are well controlled.

However, its operating margin is down below 20% (vs. 29% back in 2019). The explanation is simple.

**Reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job.**

When there’s less traffic (and subsequently less sales) in the physical stores, the operating expenses remain the same. The company still needs to pay the lease payment, its employees, the utility bills, etc. In fact, these expenses grow over time as there’s the impact of inflation.

Scaling down, by closing locations is also not a free option. Not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier, but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location.

The company is generating substantial cash flows, but I’ll argue the capital allocation is poor.

||all numbers in €m|
|:-|:-|
|Cash (January 2019)|€1.837|
|Operating cash flow|€21.541|
|Capex|(€7.772)|
|Acquisitions|(€6.559)|
|Debt|€4.887|
|Share buyback|(€2.034)|
|Dividends|(€8.229)|
|Other|€25|
|Cash (June 2024)|€3.696|

Between 2019 and H1-2024, the company generated **over €21.5 billion** in operating cash flow, or **a bit less than €14 billion after capex.**

Close to 60% of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends, and an additional 15% through share buybacks. What’s left of the free cash flow, together with additional debt, was used for acquisitions.

Why do I think the capital allocation is poor? Two main reasons:

1. Almost 80% of the share buybacks were used in 2021 and 2022, the years when the share price was the highest (and temporarily elevated). A good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares.
2. Its net debt position more than doubled, from **€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024. This is equal to \~60% of its market cap. The interest rate on their debt ranges from 0.75% to 5% and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate, it could significantly reduce its profit margins.



**4.0 What can be expected?**

Based on the latest investor presentation, there are three capital allocation priorities:

* Organic growth;
* Shareholder return; and
* Fuel high-potential adjacent businesses.

All of it, while having a **healthy financial situation and FCF generation.**

This is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company. I find this slide a bit odd for three reasons:

1. On one side they want to return capital to the shareholders, which would position them as a company **with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends**. On the other side, its history is full of **acquisitions, which is the opposite of preserving capital.**
2. The center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and FCF generation, while its net debt more than doubled in the last 5 years (**€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024).
3. Innovation is not a focus at all. Roughly 2 months ago, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category. I see a lot of potential in this area that isn’t utilized (yet).

**Growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the DNA of the company and likely what one should expect going forward.**

  
**5.0 Dividends**

The dividend per share has been steadily increasing from €4 back in 2015, to €14 in 2024. The current dividend yield is \~6%.

If the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends (instead of borrowing to acquire more companies), Kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option.

  
**6.0 High employee turnover**

At the end of 2023, the company had 48,964 employees. During the year, there were **13,403** new hires, and **11,275** employees departed. At first glance, this is no doubt a high turnover.

This sounds bad at first, but it is really difficult to decipher.

In theory, any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees (temporarily) during peak seasons. Therefore the increase, and subsequently decrease, of employees is normal. This is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive (such as sales and manufacturing).

In addition, 59% of the employees are Gen Y (1981-1995), a generation that is known for seeking career growth, which could lead to more job-hopping than average.

Given the reviews on Indeed, Glassdoor, and Comparably, there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue.

  
**7.0 The concerns**

**7.1 Balenciaga Advertising Scandal (2022)**

Back in 2022, Balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign. One of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondage-inspired outfits. This was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate.

This brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing.

In addition, given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top 3 brands (Gucci - 46%, YSL - 17%, Bottega Veneta - 9%), scandals of this kind could have a significant impact.

**7.2 Preliminary investigation by the European Commission (2023)**

In April 2023, the European Commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector. One of the inspections took place at the Italian premises of Gucci.

An investigation of this kind does not imply guilt, but if a company is found in breach of EU antitrust rules, there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros.

The investigation is still ongoing, and no conclusions have been reached.

  
**8.0 Valuation** 

This is a mature market that will be around for a very long time. Therefore, here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing Kering:

* **Revenue** \- The industry is cyclical in nature, so there will be good and bad times. Based on the past, I do not feel confident that Kering can take market share, so I expect its growth to normalize at \~3% per year, which is in line with the inflation rate.
* **Operating margin** \- The luxury market is getting more crowded, and as argued earlier, reducing operating expenses is not an easy task. Once the demand is somewhat stable, I expect the operating margin to increase to 21%.

Based on those assumptions (and a discount rate of \~9%), the fair value of the company is **€27 billion (€220/share)** which is very close to the current price of **€224/share**.

This offers an IRR of \~9%, which is slightly below the historical return of the S&P500.

  
**8.1 The Bull Case**

Those who are betting on Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following:

* Revitalization of Balenciaga & rebuilding its reputation after the controversies;
* Sustained growth in Gucci, and expansion of secondary brands like Bottega Veneta & Saint Laurent;
* The success of its newly launched beauty division, capturing market share from rivals like LVMH and Estee Lauder;
* Positive macro tailwinds;

* Utilizing pricing power;
* Integration of recent acquisitions;
* Reducing operating costs;

**If the management can pull this off, then the value per share could be 2x from today’s share price.**



**8.2 The Bear Case**

Those who are betting against Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following:

* Brand mismanagement & more scandals;
* Inability to revitalize Balenciaga;
* Inability to innovate around its primary brands;
* Failure to integrate its acquisitions & further poor M&A acquisitions;
* Negative macro tailwinds;
* Inability to innovate around E-Commerce;
* Supply chain issues;
* Competitive pressure;
* Increase in corporate tax by the French authorities

**In this scenario, the fair value per share could be below €100/share.**

Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure.

I have watched this stock for some time and it is super interesting.

• Culper research shorts ZETA and publishes findings on some misconducts from ZETA.

• Shares drop big time

• ZETA responds to all claims from culper and
""proves"" them as lies. One of examples is that Culper mentiones EY as ZETA's auditor but EY was never ZETA's auditor. It was always Deloitte...

• ZETA insiders buy large amount of shares as another sign to support the company and that Culper research is lying and playing dirty.

• Shares bounce back a bit.

• Former Louisiana attorney general leads class action suit against ZETA (another dirty move to stop a bounce back or honestly concerned ex politician?).

• Shares drop this week again.

Isn't it crazy how few people can destroy a company for personal interest using deception and dirty tricks? Or is the company the one that is corrupt?

In my opinion Culper clearly lied on many things as a strategy for their short positions, history showed that companies that were shorted by Culper did just fine in the future. Is this case the same?

What is your opinion on this? Is it good entry point, is it too risky to enter.

Btw fundamentals of this company are good.
Healthy growth, nice debt ratio and management, strong institutional ownership etc.

If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts.

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion.  If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you- doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update.

Tariffs are the biggest news today, 25% on Canada/Mexico and 35% on China.

Rivian Receives Conditional Commitment for up to $6.6 Billion Loan from the U.S. Department of Energy,1h0815y,TrumpsGrazedEar,2024-11-26 15:03:15,282,0.97,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h0815y/rivian_receives_conditional_commitment_for_up_to/,"RVINE, Calif., November 26, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American all-electric automaker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced it has received conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program for a loan of up to $6.6 billion (including $6 billion of principal and approximately $600 million of capitalized interest) to accelerate its growth and leadership of electric vehicle design, development and manufacturing in the United States.

If finalized, the loan would support the construction of Rivian’s next facility in Stanton Springs North, near the city of Social Circle, Georgia, substantially expanding the company’s domestic production capacity to support demand from the United States and international markets. This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the company’s midsize platform, which underpins the R2, a midsize SUV, and the R3/R3X, a midsize crossover. Designed, engineered, and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability, function, performance, and pricing, Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company’s long-term growth and profitability.

The DOE loan would provide an important boost to the U.S. automotive industrial base, enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry.

Rivian intends to build the facility in two phases, each resulting in 200,000 units of annual production capacity, for a total of 400,000 units of annual capacity–supporting the sale of American EVs in international markets. Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. Rivian is expected to create approximately 7,500 operations jobs through 2030 at the company’s future manufacturing facility in Georgia. This is in addition to 2,000 expected full-time construction jobs that will utilize the region’s significant talent and workforce to further strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem. These jobs complement the thousands Rivian has already created and plans to maintain at its current plant in Normal, Illinois, which have bolstered the local and regional economy.

""This loan will help create thousands of new American jobs and further strengthen U.S. leadership in EV manufacturing and technology,"" said Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. ""This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability. A robust ecosystem of U.S. companies developing and manufacturing EVs is critical for the U.S. to maintain its long-term leadership in transportation.""

Rivian plans to design and build a fully modern manufacturing facility at the Stanton Springs Site, less than one hour’s drive from downtown Atlanta, employing modern construction techniques and advanced environmental management while preserving natural spaces and investing actively in the surrounding communities.

Over the history of the loan program, DOE has helped energize American EV manufacturing with billions in financing for this strategically important industry, including loans to General Motors and Tesla.

While this conditional commitment indicates DOE’s intent to finance the project, DOE and the company must satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the Department of Energy enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan. If finalized, the loan would be secured by all assets of the project and fixed assets and guarantees of the parent company, Rivian Automotive, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries.

"California plan excludes Tesla from new EV tax credits, governor's office says",1gzx5tr,Puginator,2024-11-26 04:50:54,696,0.82,291,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gzx5tr/california_plan_excludes_tesla_from_new_ev_tax/,"Tesla's electric vehicles likely would not qualify for California's new state tax credits under a proposal in the works if President-elect Donald Trump scraps the federal tax credit for EV purchases, Governor Gavin Newsom's office said on Monday.
Tesla shares closed down 4%.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

Ganja Bear Case (and one possible exception),1gzfcoy,Sorry-Palpitation-70,2024-11-25 15:22:01,0,0.43,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gzfcoy/ganja_bear_case_and_one_possible_exception/,"I think cannabis is an abysmally bad investment opportunity (with one exception) and almost no one knows why, because the precise nature of how THC as a drug operates isn't well understood by people who aren't both habitual consumers \*and\* up-to-date with knowledge on that sector this past decade or so.

It's the following issue: Let's say it's 2010 when cannabis is still illegal everywhere and I want to get high, I light up a single (1) joint with my friend, we smoke for 20 minutes, and then we're giggling. We go to buy some twice a month or so. A few years later it's been legalized and a ton of money floods into the space. Growers are all trying to compete with each other to take advantage of the laws changing, everyone wants to make stronger weed that gets you high more quickly than the other kinds, to draw customers to them, get market share and so on. ""Buy my iridescent purple galactic stardust reefer that gets you as high in one puff as 10x that amount of the neighboring place's stuff.""

This is a race to the bottom. Soon everyone is selling incredibly strong stuff, but you need \*far less\* of it to get the same high. Habitual users spend less than 10% of what they used to on weed now, everything is absurdly strong and cheap because of this competition. In addition you now have hash oil, edibles, dab pens, tinctures, you name it. Not just regular flower.

I never smoked much anyway, but in the rare case I want a mini-vacation now, I can take a vial of Tincture and put \*one drop\* under my tongue. Within two hours the world is spinning. It's so strong I never use it as anything other than a sleeping aid about once a month. A single bottle of this costs about $65, and it comfortably lasts me an entire year. This is a disaster for the industry because I almost never need to give them business. It's so strong that I rarely need to make a purchase at all. And no need for all the paraphernalia with it either. No vapes, pipes, lighters etc. The bottle comes with an eyedropper. Even if I use it often and develop a high tolerance, I still rarely need to go out for more. My friend and I have no reason to go smoke or spend much money on the supplies for it when for 1/100th the price we can get the same high now, assuming one of us has a tincture (or dab vape pen, or edible, or a newly exotic and potent strain) at home.

Compare this with alcohol, where you can't make, say, vodka much stronger than it is. It's impossible for me to come up with a 10x stronger vodka to put my competitors out of business because it's physically impossible for alcohol to exist at room temperature at concentrations higher than \~97% (I think), and vodka is already around 45% and can't reasonably go much higher (taste etc). Also there is a social nature to it that weed lacks, beer works more as a refreshment beverage like coke etc.

Or cigarettes, where even if you have a huge nicotine tolerance from constant Zyn use, the nature of the substance requires you to take it every couple hours to keep from getting jittery. You can't just get a year's supply of nicotine in a bottle because (first of all it'd be fatal with a slight dosage error) you need to have it in measured amounts you can take every 2-4 hours regardless of how much you're used to consuming, assuming you're dependent on it to begin with of course. And so it is a consistent business for sellers. This is most true of cigarettes, but also applies to vapes and pouches, which have similarly excellent profit margins. All of these a nicotine addict must consume regularly. Regulations also limit how much nicotine you can put in each product.

It is a subscription model, in short, while weed is equivalent to motor oil in terms of how often someone (a very heavy user to boot) has to go out and buy some, and how much they spend. Alcohol has some issues as well of lesser magnitude that I can go into elsewhere, but can lean on its usefulness in social situations whereas weed cannot.

The only exception to this? Turning Point Brands (TPB) stock, because they don't sell weed. They sell rolling papers and other paraphernalia for it. Which is indeed still a growing business if it gets legalized in more places and benefits from the greater proliferation of the stuff. Actual weed sellers do not, because the increased proliferation is offset by people needing to buy less of it for the same results due to increased THC concentration in the products. You can't sell 1/10th as much paper to people for the same effect, or at least it's less affected by this issue. The company also is wisely getting into nicotine pouches although this is very ambitious of them to compete with the tobacco majors directly on something. Not sure how that'll work out. Keep in mind this is a small cap company, less than $1 billion in market cap, reflecting how little profit there is to be made even on the periphery of this sector. But it's one small and thriving business I can find that has benefited from all this quite nicely. Not sure how much more it can grow, it's probably overvalued now, but in the past year or so it's risen strongly.

Otherwise? Cronos and other weed stocks? Bunk. For the birds. There might be an exception for medical marijuana (CBD) companies but that's pure conjecture as far as I know. You can make condensed CBD products just the same.",2024-11-25,0.9966,Positive,"['THC', 'TPB', 'THC', 'CBD', 'CBD']"

Yeah I know it mainly trades on Toronto but just get a broker that supports Toronto, eg IBKR. They’re planning to list on US soon but by then it will probably already have taken off...

Their earnings report was stellar: growth of 38% yoy, it is actually **PROFITABLE** \- none of the other space companies are profitable - profitability with adjusted EBITDA of $55.5 million, up 30% YoY, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%, net income up 60% yoy, and net debt adjusted EBITDA ratio of just 0.8x (so zero risk of dilution). However, post earnings the stock was mostly flat. Why? Their reported backlog was unchanged from previous quarter report (backlog is 4.6B btw).

But if any of you folks had bothered to tune in to the call, you would have heard the CEO say that it is a fact that by year end they will be **definitely be signing a new contract worth 750M** – of these, only 300M is recorded in backlog – a**n additional $450M is going to be added** upon finalization and t**his will happen by year’s end.** They in fact stated during the Q&A that they are confident they will be finishing 2024 with $5B backlog. They also said MDA’s satellite systems division alone has a $**15B+ pipeline** of potential projects, thanks to its Aurora-class satellites tailored for low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations.

Still not convinced? Consider:

\> MDA is building a new 185,000 sq. ft. facility in Quebec, **capable of producing two satellites per day** starting in late 2025.

\>Planet labs is currently generating about 200million in revenue per year. MDA’s geointelligence segment is also generating about 200million in revenue per year. However, MDA’s geo segment represents **only about 20%** of MDA’s total revenue. PL’s marketcap is currently almost **1B**. MDA is 3.1 CAD = **2.2B USD**. Oh, and PL is currently operating at a loss (though that might change next report) but MDA is running a profit. Based on this fact alone, MDA’s mkt cap should be at least double than what it is.

Speculate on GOOG - what'd be the best countermove against DoJ slaps? ,1gywuwe,Straight_Turnip7056,2024-11-24 23:19:02,223,0.88,229,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gywuwe/speculate_on_goog_whatd_be_the_best_countermove/,"For those who were sleeping/partying on the weekend, the following happened:

* DoJ said, Google should divest off Chrome and may not reenter the browser market for five years
* prohibited from ""acquiring any interests in search rivals, potential entrants, and rival search or search ads-related AI products""
* halt all ""anticompetitive payments to distributors, including Apple, Samsung"" so that Google isn't the default search engine on their devices
* content creators can choose to opt-out of Google crawlers to train its AI

Most obvious historical comparison is case against Microsoft Corp. in 2001; the DoJ tried to split Microsoft up due to its hold over the web browser market on Windows, though this case **ultimately resulted in a settlement**. With that in mind, it is possible, the DoJ will go this way, this time.

* Search is close to 50% revenue of Google \[Q3 results\]
* Browsers market shares: Chrome 60%, Safari 18%, Edge 8% \[Source can be contested, because it's larger devices stats only\]
* Android - 70% market share in handheld devices

GOOG has to fight hard to ensure a high search traffic. It may have a few options up its sleeves.

- Lower revenue (year over year)
- Lower net income (year over year)
- Lower earnings per share (year over year)

In my opinion when revenue (or net income) is declining, and not flat or increasing, it is a concern that the company could be on the brink of a big downturn. Especially in a continued pattern of these results.

However, I often see companies with these symptoms, (sometimes in different combinations but at least two of these are lower year over year), however the chart is very bullish at times…

Delaware Funds by Macquarie,1gy4ckp,Maccadawg,2024-11-23 22:35:15,10,0.76,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gy4ckp/delaware_funds_by_macquarie/,"Does anyone have any insight into Delaware Funds managed by Macquarie? 

Unfortunately, I was persuaded to purchase into one of the small / mid cap mutual funds in December 2020. Obviously the market was on a bit of a run there, but everything about the fund (historical build up, Morningstar ratings, length of existence of the fund, recommendations by publications, YoY performance,  etc) led me to believe it was a reasonable, if somewhat more aggressive, investment.  

It was all well and good for about a year, as the market rebounded from Covid and this particular fund hummed along with the rest of the economy.   Articles like [this in the mainstream press](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/4-stock-picks-for-the-post-pandemic-nesting-economy-from-a-five-star-money-manager-11636995166?mod=bnbh_mwarticle) lent further credence that the fund was solid and the fund managers respected by financial journalism. 

And then it did a capital gains distribution (historically very normal for this fund) in December 2021 and then the share price immediately started its plummet.  Like, overnight, lost $15/share.  Similarly, it went seemingly overnight from a Morningstar 5 rating to a 2 rating.  It continued to fall from there. 

  
I guess I am one of those silly buy and hold people.  I always assume that short term losses will eventually be made up in the long term.  Since then....no. 

  
Earlier this year, Delaware merged a couple of their funds, so DFDIX became IYMIX.   As far as I can tell, the holdings in IYMIX are not radically different than what DFDIX held.   In a market that has been turbo charged for the past year, the growths of this fund have been glacial.   I realize that the holdings are small / mid cap and those are ostensibly still being knocked around by high interest rates, but the three years since that initial freefall following the capital gains distribution has not really begun to make up the ground that the fund dramatically lost. 

I've literally never been in a mutual fund that actively lost money for me.  Plenty have not grown in dramatic ways, but actually halving of value?  That's never happened before. 

Does anyone have any insight into this investment company or explanation why a small / midcap fund would depreciate to such a dramatic extent and fail to recover over a period of years when stock market growth is explosive? 

  
I'm a little heartsick at the thought of just cutting losses and investing in Vanguard or something but it's been really stressful.  

Thanks in advance.  (And yes, I realize I should have been using trailing stops, but didn't, so no lectures there, please.)",2024-11-23,0.9732,Positive,"['DFDIX', 'IYMIX', 'IYMIX', 'DFDIX']"

Manchester United stock (NYSE: MANU) – potential to grow,1gxinau,TheTerrorOfKnowing,2024-11-23 02:48:21,0,0.44,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gxinau/manchester_united_stock_nyse_manu_potential_to/,"According to Forbes magazine Manchester United is the second most valuable club in football, only behind Real Madrid. Only Real Madrid and Barcelona have more fans in the world. This is despite the fact that last major trophy they won is Premier League in 2013.  This was the last season with Sir Alex Ferguson at the helm – he is the best manager in history of this club. He retired and since then they are struggling a lot and underperforming. Last season they finished 8^(th) in the Premier League, this season they are 13^(th). Disappointment. They play in Europa League, second tier competition in Europe. The real money is in Champions League.

They have a tremendous potential. Big history, a lot of fans, a lot of money. They should compete for the most important throphies every year. But they didn’t in previous years and fans are angry about that.

Things are subject to change though. At the end of 2023 Sir James Ratcliffe bought 25% of club’s shares. He is the fan of the club and he has a lot to say about how the club is run. He is committed to rebuilding club and bring back glory the club aspire to. On January 2024 Omar Berrada was appointed as new CEO of the club, chief executive officer. He joined United after 13 years spent in Manchester City that was the most successful club in England during this period. On July 2024 Dan Ashworth started to work as sporting director. He worked for Newcastle and Brighton previously. He did a really god job there. In Brighton under his watch they transferred in Caicedo, Mac Allister, Cucurella, Mitoma and Trossard, they sold them later for more money. In Newcastle he was in charged when they bought Isak, Gordon, Barnes, Tonali and Botman. Great business. Recently they hired Ruben Amorim, who was successful in Sporting Lisboa. In the summer he was considered as new Liverpool FC manager, eventually they decided to go with Arne Slot who is excellent in his new role.

The future for Manchester United is bright. They have a competent people running the club. Ruben Amorim is one of the best of young managers in the world and seems to be a really good pick who is able to transform the whole club like Jurgen Klopp did it at Liverpool in the last decade. He needs time but he seems to be capable of making Manchester United great again. They were underperforming in the last 10 years but finally they addressed the issues and should be performing better. They need a time, of course, to build strong team. The thing is – if they perform on the pitch, they earn more money. I believe it is the matter of time before they are on the top. And when they reach this level, when they compete amongst really the best, their stock price should be much higher than it is now.

I think they will be a strong again very soon, they will compete and good performance on the pitch will result with big amount of cash going to the club. The next 10 years should be much better than the last 10 years. Currently their stock price is 17,47 USD. They certainly has potential for more. One more reason is – there are more and more money in football every year so this is another factor in favor of this stock.

I think that this club will compete for Premier League and Champions League in 2-4 years and it should have a huge impact on their finances. My opinion is this stock has potential to grow.

Are we putting too much faith in generative AI? Could this hurt AI investments more broadly?,1gxezqq,MarshallGrover,2024-11-23 00:11:10,51,0.8,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gxezqq/are_we_putting_too_much_faith_in_generative_ai/,"Obviously a lot of money is being made off of AI-related stocks. I'm not one of those lucky investors. Part of the reason is that I fear we're not in a general AI bubble, as many have discussed, but rather a *generative AI* bubble. I'd appreciate hearing how others feel about this.

Right now, by far the bulk of investment is focused on generative AI (especially LLMs), with NVDA at or very near the center of it all, thanks to its GPUs. Meanwhile, alternative AI approaches (e.g., neuromorphic computing, symbolic AI, reinforcement learning, and hybrid models) have been getting far less attention.

The problem? As impressive as it may seem, generative AI has some significant (and inherent) drawbacks:

* Factually unreliable outputs (it can’t reliably distinguish fact from fiction)
* Probabilistic reasoning (no true causal understanding)
* High computational costs (questionable sustainability)
* Limited real-world problem-solving abilities

At some point, the reality of generative AI's limitations will become apparent enough to investors that we could see an AI market correction or even collapse. This would not only hurt AI stocks like NVDA, but it could also starve funding for alternative AI approaches that have long-term potential yet have been largely overlooked.

Their manufacturing facility will be completed in weeks. They have received a [$400M backing from Stellantis](https://beyondspx.com/article/archer-aviation-pioneering-the-future-of-electric-aviation) for production. This is not some vaporware - they have real manufacturing power. The company will pump out 650 aircraft yearly. That translates to billions in revenue when each Midnight sells for $5M+.

Regarding FAA certification, they have [already nailed Phase 3 of 4](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/archer-announces-third-quarter-2024-210500611.html).

 I won't go into details of thier report, but after reading it I believe it is of very low quality (they even got the ZETAs auditor wrong lol).

After the decline of the price I was tempted to start building a position, especially since the SP was starting to recover. However, today in PM the shares are going back to around 20$. Another short seller (Lauren Balik) has published a report. To me it once again seems like a blatant attempt of trying to lower the price. It is overblown and full of speculation. She also published similiar articles on NVDA, APP, SNOW. But the market is dumping anyway.

My question is - how likely is it going to actually hurt the company long term? Is it too risky to enter now? Do you know of some other companies targeted by mulriple short sellers In the past (I would like to examine how they did or did not recover)?

The new agreement clarifies Microsoft Azure as C3.ai's preferred cloud services platform and C3.ai's AI applications as Azure's preferred enterprise solutions. Although the two have been working together since 2018, this announcement pushes the market's focus on its AI potential higher.

Underestimated potential: c3.ai's revenue grew 21% in the quarter and is expected to grow 24% going forward. Current market capitalization is \~$4 billion and trades at a multiple of 11x its FY2025 revenue target.

Pilots: The company has 224 pilots, 85% of which are active, representing a 117% year-over-year increase in the number of pilots. 70% of pilots are expected to be converted into formal contracts.

Future Potential: Revenues are expected to pick up to 30% from current growth rates through pilots to formal deals. 2026 FY projected revenue target is $462 million, with a share price potential of up to $36 if it reaches an 8x EV/revenue valuation.

While the partnership has boosted market enthusiasm, I would wait for market sentiment to pull back before getting in. In addition, the conversion of pilots to full-fledged programs is key to future growth.

It has done rather well, consistently giving returns of 25%+ annually (except 2022). 

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I’m considering: 

50% S&P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr & ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative

My thesis was very much connected to an alternative investment vehicle into Bitcoin.  Even though I have BTC as a holding in my crypto, I was more after exposure in an equity portfolio.

To cut a long story short, I bought it when it was no mainstream and no ETF's were existing.

I must admit, I sat on a loss for about one year in MSTR.  Buying at $48.10 (split adjusted), and for the longest time sitting at the $25-$30 range, BTC was consolidating and I was fine with that.

If people understand what MSTR are doing, this playbook with bonds and hedging BTC was already in play for a long time, I was lucky enough to understand this quite early and and bought it quite early.  The difference being now that BTC is on a breakout and other companies are now looking into this method as well, the eyes on MSTR has multiplied exponentially .

Fast forward one year, and and the FOMO crowd arrived, and with that volatility.

Here is what I learnt when the FOMO arrived:

1. The stock is no longer trading on anything but emotion and speculation.
2. Valuations do not matter anymore.  The premium on BTC was as low as 1.5 less than one year go, reaching a peak earlier this week at 3.5
3. The stock goes up like crazy, and comes down like crazy, and when this happens, it's time to exit as there is nothing that is in your control.
4. There is so much manipulation (e.g. the citron report, Social media, Mainstream coverage), on what... a damn tweet!  it is not really easy to understand how this will move, so at this point it is just gambling.

I held my position up to the $543 level, and eventually my stop losses triggered yesterday around the $500 level.  So after 1.5 years, I am out of the MSTR trade.

The lesson I learnt is when the crowds arrive, turn round and walk away.

I still believe in the MSTR playbook, but will only come back when I am at the front of the queue buying at a negotiated price not when I am in a bidding war with gamblers.",2024-11-22,-0.9736,Negative,"['MSTR', 'BTC', 'ETF', 'MSTR', 'BTC', 'MSTR', 'BTC', 'BTC', 'MSTR', 'FOMO', 'FOMO', 'BTC', 'MSTR', 'MSTR']"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Intuit shares drop as quarterly forecast misses estimates due to delayed revenue,1gwxwu8,Puginator,2024-11-22 08:28:33,41,0.92,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwxwu8/intuit_shares_drop_as_quarterly_forecast_misses/,"Intuit shares fell 6% in extended trading Thursday after the finance software maker issued a revenue forecast for the current quarter that trailed analysts’ estimates due to some sales being delayed.

Here’s how the company performed in comparison with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.50 adjusted vs. $2.35 expected

Revenue: $3.28 billion vs. $3.14 billion

Revenue increased 10% year over year in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income fell to $197 million, or 70 cents per share, from $241 million, or 85 cents per share, a year ago.

While results for the fiscal first quarter topped estimates, second-quarter guidance was light. Intuit said it anticipates a single-digit decline in revenue from the consumer segment because of promotional changes for the TurboTax desktop software in retail environments. While that will affect revenue timing, it won’t have any impact on the full 2025 fiscal year.

Intuit called for second-quarter earnings of $2.55 to $2.61 per share, with $3.81 billion to $3.85 billion in revenue. The consensus from LSEG was $3.20 per share and $3.87 billion in revenue.

For the full year, Intuit expects $19.16 to $19.36 in adjusted earnings per share on $18.16 billion to $18.35 billion in revenue. That implies revenue growth of between 12% and 13%. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for $19.33 in adjusted earnings per share and $18.26 billion in revenue.

Revenue from Intuit’s global business solutions group came in at $2.5 billion in the first quarter. The figure was up 9% and in line with estimates, according to StreetAccount. Formerly known as the small business and self-employed segment, the group includes Mailchimp, QuickBooks, small business financing and merchant payment processing.

“We are seeing good progress serving mid-market customers in MailChimp, but are seeing higher churn from smaller customers,” Sandeep Aujla, Intuit’s finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. “We are addressing this by making product enhancements and driving feature discoverability and adoption to improve first-time use and customer retention.”

Better outcomes are a few quarters away, Aujla said.

CreditKarma revenue came in at $524 million, above StreetAccount’s $430 million consensus.

At Thursday’s close, Intuit shares were up about 9% so far in 2024, while the S&P 500 has gained almost 25% in the same period.

On Tuesday Intuit shares slipped 5% after The Washington Post said President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed “Department of Government Efficiency” had discussed developing a mobile app for federal income tax filing. But a mobile app for submitting returns from Intuit is “already available to all Americans,” CEO Sasan Goodarzi told CNBC’s Jon Fortt.

Goodarzi said on CNBC that he’s personally communicating with leaders of the incoming presidential administration.

On the earnings call, Goodarzi sounded optimistic about the economy.

“Our belief, which is not baked into our guidance, is that we will see an improved environment as we look ahead in 2025, particularly just with some of the things that I mentioned earlier around just interest rates, jobs, the regulatory environment,” he said. “These things have a real burden on businesses.

Viking Therapeutics shared updates on its obesity treatment program for VK2735 at ObesityWeek:

Subjects achieved mean weight loss of up to 8.2% from baseline and 6.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss after 28 days of daily dosing at 100 mg. As far as I am concerned, I believe this is more effective than Mounjaro which demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately 4% of starting body weight after 4 weeks of treatment. 

Also, Oral VK2735 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with 99% of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. The oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments by offering greater convenience. 

Let’s look at subcutaneous VK2735 Result(or like doses): Weekly subcutaneous injections led to weight reductions of up to 14.7% from baseline. Up to 88% of treated patients achieved ≥10% weight loss, compared to 4% for placebo. Weight loss was progressive throughout the study, with no plateau at 13 weeks.

The obesity drug market is projected to grow to $130 billion by 2030, offering significant upside for VK2735. This is also important because at this size of a market, it can hold many or multiple big players. Analysts also predict Viking could become a takeover target due to its strong pipeline. This would boost the price up to 3 digits.

What’s more! The company also received praise for its liver disease treatment VK2809, which showed positive results in a Phase 2b trial for MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), a serious liver condition affecting 22 million Americans. Reductions in liver fat ranging from 37% to 55% at 52 weeks, with response rates (≥30% reduction) as high as 88%, far exceed typical benchmarks. 

The clinical data reinforce VK2735's potential as a best-in-class obesity treatment with effective weight loss, strong safety, and durability of results. The only reason why the stock hasn’t sky-rocketed is because of fear mongering by market makers in the aftermath of RFK junior, and as far as I’m concerned, diabete and liver diseases will not go away and the desperation I’ve seen for patients to obtain these drug is mad. ",2024-11-22,0.9133,Positive,"['MASH', 'RFK']"

Gap, which runs Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and its namesake banner, is now expecting fiscal 2024 sales to be up between 1.5% and 2%, compared with previous guidance of “up slightly.” That’s ahead of the 0.4% growth that LSEG analysts had expected, and bodes well for the all-important holiday shopping season, which is now underway. 

The company is also anticipating gross margins and operating income will grow more than it previously expected.

Shares surged about 13% in extended trading.

Here’s how the nation’s largest specialty apparel retailer performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $3.83 billion vs. $3.81 billion expected

Gap’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $274 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with $218 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales rose to $3.83 billion, up about 2% from $3.78 billion a year earlier.

Across Gap’s business, unseasonably warm weather affected sales by about 1 percentage point during the quarter, while storms and hurricanes led overall store sales to fall by 2%, CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC in an interview. 

“We had unusual circumstances, hurricanes, storms that led to almost 180 closures at the peak of the impact,” said Dickson, adding the storms affected Old Navy, Gap’s largest brand by revenue, the most. 

As soon as the weather turned around, sales “rebounded” and the holiday shopping season is off to a “strong start” so far, said Dickson. 

“We are energized about the holiday. Our teams are really focused on executing our plans. If we compare ourselves to where we were last year, our brands are in a much more pronounced place than they were last year,” he said. “We’ve got stronger brand identities and we’re more practiced in our playbook that we talk a lot about, driving better product, better pricing, more relevance, better consumer experience and excellence in execution.” 

Since Dickson took the helm of Gap a little over a year ago, he’s worked to turn around the business after years of declines. Under his direction, the company has leaned into nostalgic marketing and celebrity partnerships to reclaim cultural relevance. Sales have grown for the last four quarters in a row, but the company is still smaller than it once was, and critics say it needs to do more to fix its product assortment and drive full-price selling.

Here’s a closer look at each brand’s performance: 

**Old Navy:** Gap said sales at its largest brand grew 1% to $2.2 billion, while comparable sales were flat, shy of the 0.9% growth that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Old Navy’s kids category was particularly affected by the warmer weather, said Dickson. 

**Gap:** Gap’s eponymous banner grew 1% to $899 million during the quarter, while comparable sales were up 3% — better than the 2.3% growth Wall Street expected, according to StreetAccount. The brand has seen four straight quarters of positive comparable sales and is benefiting from better marketing and product, the company said. 

**Banana Republic:** The trendy workwear line grew sales 2% to $469 million while comparable sales fell 1%, a bit worse than the 0.8% drop that StreetAccount had expected. The brand has worked to turn around its men’s business, which drove results during the quarter. Overall, it is still focused “on fixing the fundamentals,” the company said. 

**Athleta:** The athleisure arm of Gap’s empire grew sales by 4% to $290 million while comparable sales were up 5%. The results weren’t comparable to estimates. In the year-ago period, comparable sales were down 19% at Athleta. Under its new CEO, former Alo Yoga boss Chris Blakeslee, the brand has managed to turn things around.

Deep dive into Etsy - On a path to a dangerous spiral,1gwo236,k_ristovski,2024-11-22 01:03:02,55,0.88,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwo236/deep_dive_into_etsy_on_a_path_to_a_dangerous/,"**1.0 Introduction**

Etsy started by brilliantly carving out a niche in handmade and vintage goods, but now it faces challenges that threaten its unique spot in e-commerce and I’ll argue it is going down the path to a dangerous spiral.

The idea to connect buyers with sellers of handmade/vintage goods is amazing, and there’s no doubt that there is demand for it.

Any marketplace has two important metrics:

* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website. Etsy decided to use **Gross Merchandise Sales** (“GMS“), which is just a different term.
* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMS.

Its GMS increased from \~$4 billion in 2018 (prior to the pandemic) to $13.5 billion in 2021. However, since then, Etsy has experienced a decline and the GMS in 2023 was $13.2 billion. The lack of growth is either a lack of demand or a lack of supply in the marketplace.

**2.0 The real problem**

The company discloses the number of active buyers and sellers, and together, they paint quite a picture.

The number of active sellers continued to grow. From 2021 to 2023, it increased from 7.5 million to 9 million.

The number of buyers has been flat.

Economics101 teaches us a simple lesson: ***If the demand is stable, and there is an increase in supply, the prices will decrease.***

Economics also teaches that ***lower prices would attract more buyers, increasing the demand.***

***So, where are the buyers?***

As Etsy doesn’t (and cannot) check the quality of all the products, more and more AI-generated product images combined with dropshipping flood the market. Here's a comment from a Reddit user that in my opinion does a great job summarizing the development:

""*Drop-shipping has absolutely ruined online marketplaces. I used to adore Etsy when it first started, but now its just absolute garbage. You have to reverse image search everything nowadays to make sure it's the real deal and actually handmade. This recently happened to me when I was trying to buy some pretty dice for my dnd group. Turned out it was a scam using a real artisan's pictures to sell their cheap shit. Thankfully, I was able to rectify the issue, but it was a hustle.*""

The U.S. sellers used to contribute over 75% of Etsy’s revenue a decade ago. Now, it’s down to \~50%.

I’ll argue that this might lead to a spiral that will harm Etsy in the long run, with the events being:

1. Increase in low-value products on Etsy.
2. The low-value products will be perceived as a better deal when compared to the high-value products as they are cheaper.
3. The sellers of high-value products will sell fewer products, and some of them will eventually leave Etsy.
4. The buyers will be disappointed by the low-value products and will not use Etsy as much (or at all).

**3.0 What is Etsy doing?**

Etsy is spending \~30% of its revenue on Marketing (vs. 20% a decade ago) and has even engaged in TV ads to raise awareness and bring new customers.

Over the last few years, the company has been spending $700-800m per year, only to keep the revenue flat. It is accepting the fact that buyers will be disappointed, and the strategy is to replace them with new ones.

**4.0 The take-rate**

The only other way for Etsy to grow its revenue is to increase its take-rate, and its share of the GMS.

The company splits its revenue into two groups:

* **Marketplace revenue** (\~73% of total) - These are **required** fees that cannot be avoided (Transaction fees, payment processing fees, listing fees).
* **Service revenue** (\~27% of total) - These are **optional**, such as on-site advertising, shipping labels, etc.

Its take-rate is incredibly high at \~21%, double from a decade ago. For comparison, eBay’s take rate is \~14%.

**5.0 Terrible management decisions**

As the company was reaching its peak, the management decided to make 3 large acquisitions:

* **Reverb** (Aug 15th, 2019) - A marketplace for new, used, and vintage music gear was acquired for **$270 million**.
* **Elo 7** (July 2nd, 2021) - Also known as the “Etsy of Brazil”, a Brazil-based marketplace for unique, handmade items was acquired for **$212 million**.
* **Depop** (July 12th, 2021) - a global fashion resale marketplace was acquired for \~**$1.5 billion**.

It is important to note that Depop had an annual revenue of **$70 million!** No, this is not a typo. Etsy paid over 20x its revenue to acquire Depop!

Well, not that long later, in Q3-2022, the company recorded impairment charges of **over $1 billion** for Depop and Elo7. No better way to destroy shareholders’ value quickly, than by overpaying for an acquisition.

A year later, in Q3-2023, Elo7 was sold at a loss.

**6.0 Historical financial performance**

Historically, this is still an impressive growth. Its revenue grew from <$200 million a decade ago, to $2.8 billion in the last twelve months and its gross margin remains stable at \~70%.

Its operating margin is lingering around 12% now, as both marketing & product development as % of revenue have been increasing. The increase in marketing expense (as % of revenue) has already been highlighted in a previous section. It is necessary to maintain the buyers’ base. So potential future improvements in the operating margin can only arise by decreasing the product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue).

**7.0 Valuation**

The two key variables when it comes to valuing a company are:

* **Revenue** \- Given that the number of active buyers hasn’t grown in the last few years, it is difficult to expect revenue growth above inflation.
* **Operating margin** \- I do think there’s room to improve the margins by reducing product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue). My assumption is that that it will increase to 14% over time.

Based on my input, the fair value of the company is **$3.2 billion ($29/share)**. This is significantly lower than the current market cap of **$5.7 billion ($51/share)**.

Anyone betting on Etsy is ultimately betting that:

1. The number of low-value products will decrease over time.
2. The number of buyers will start growing again
3. Etsy can continue increasing its take-rate, without losing sellers of high-value products.
4. The management will not engage in acquisition (as they are clearly bad at it).

If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only ""browser stocks"" that there are. At least the only one of any substance. 



On the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.

I’ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I’ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.

I’ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I’m buying both to more or less hedge my bets.

I think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.

This in hindsight was an excellent decision as almost all my investments in the S&P/Nasdaq have outperformed the ones listed in Europe. So do any American guys look at European markets and see any opportunity to create alpha or are bullish on the EU markets. 

There’s an argument to be made that potentially investing into EU serves as a way to diversify and lower exposure to US markets. But I find it very hard to find good European companies with solid fundamentals that have good stock performance. Could be a myriad of reasons including liquidity, slower growth, more regulation and government oversight. 

Personally the three companies I still have in my portfolio in the EU markets is RR, NVO and LVMH. LVMH is slowing down but most likely due to luxury market turmoil and exposure to China. Additionally NVO is listed on NYSE and had uptil recently performed rather well.

So finally my question being are any guys actively eschewing the American markets for European ones or actively increasing their allocation, if so would love to know the rationale.

I've been a big fan of PANW for the last 2 years. While the billings decline isn't great, it's been expected as the company pushes for platformization. I anticipate this to be great in the long term outlook, but short term, may seem like growth is slowing. Platformization will make their services sticky and harder for companies to leave because they'll be integrated across the business across multiple levels.

Although I'm a big fan of the stock, I will admit it's an expensive one. A lot hinges on future growth of the whole industry and if there are any signs of slowed growth, I think this one will hurt for investors buying at these levels. I'm not in cybersecurity so I'm not sure the likelihood of that, but I'd keep an eye on it.

The complaint alleges ASML misrepresentet or failed to disclose that: (1) the issues being faced by suppliers, like ASML, in the semiconductor industry were much more severe than ASML had indicated to investors, (2) the pace of recovery of sales in the semiconductor industry was much slower than Defendants had publicy acknowledged; (3) ASML had created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to anticipated growth, while downplaying risk from macroeconomic and industry fluctiatinos, as well as stronger regulations restricting the export of semiconductor technology.

**11/19 - The Law Offices of Frank R. Cruz**

Adani Group shares nosedive after chairman Gautam Adani charged with fraud in New York,1gw7gn4,Puginator,2024-11-21 09:33:57,359,0.96,104,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gw7gn4/adani_group_shares_nosedive_after_chairman_gautam/,"India’s Adani Group saw shares of its companies plunge Thursday after its billionaire chairman Gautam Adani was indicted in a New York federal court over his alleged involvement in an extensive bribery and fraud operation.

The 62-year-old billionaire and the seven other defendants have been accused of paying over $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to secure solar energy contracts that could generate more than $2 billion in profits.

The Indian group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises fell 10%, while the company in the eye of the storm Adani Green Energy tanked 17.28%. Adani Energy fell 20%. 

Adani Power lost 13.81%, Adani Port’s share price dropped 10%, while the group’s retail arm Adani Wilmar shed 7.87%.

The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index slid 0.63% in its first hour of trade.

Adani, along with two executives from Adani Green Energy Limited — his nephew Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain — have been charged with misleading U.S. and international investors about the company’s adherence to antibribery and anticorruption standards while raising over $3 billion to finance energy projects.

The five-count indictment in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn also accused Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, former executives of the renewable energy firm Azure Power Global, along with three former employees of the Canadian institutional investor Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec — Saurabh Agarwal, Cyril Cabanes, and Deepak Malhotra.

CDPQ said it is aware of the charges filed. “Those employees were all terminated in 2023 and CDPQ is cooperating with U.S. authorities,” the investor said in an email.

This comes after the conglomerate spent the bulk of last year attempting to move beyond the allegations of accounting fraud and “brazen stock manipulation” made by shortseller firm Hindenburg Research. 

“Since releasing our January 2023 report identifying Adani as the largest corporate con in history, we have never wavered in our view, nor has Adani ever refuted our findings,” Hindenburg said in a statement to CNBC on Thursday.

The conglomerate had rebutted the claims, adding that it has “always been in compliance with all laws.”

Extract: The first vulnerability relates to financial markets, which remain susceptible to sudden, sharp adjustments. While recent high-volatility episodes were short-lived and had only limited impact on the financial system, underlying vulnerabilities make financial markets prone to bouts of volatility in the future. First, record-low equity premia and compressed corporate bond spreads are signs that investors may be underestimating the likelihood and potential impact of adverse scenarios. Second, concentration of equity market capitalisation and earnings among a handful of companies, notably in the United States, has increased greatly in recent years, raising concerns over the possibility of an asset price bubble connected to artificial intelligence.

My HYS was returning $25+ per month. I made $60 in 2 days. And kept $8k on SPY.

What am I missing here? Even if I stop now and don’t sell for the whole month, I still did better than HYSA. 

Are there tax implications (or complications) for realizing lots of micro short term gains? 
I believe the tax bracket of HYSA and short term gains is the same.

Okta - my analysis and thoughts,1gvcfnz,flunkyy,2024-11-20 05:50:39,20,0.81,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gvcfnz/okta_my_analysis_and_thoughts/,"I'd appreciate any and all feedback to see if I feel I'm on track or not and your perspective on my take. I know Okta took the hit after the social engineering ""hack"", but there's no doubt they're still the leader in the IAM space. I believe there's way more upside, but I also realize that they \*could\* be a serious M&A target.

**Executive Investment Summary: Okta, Inc.**

**Overview**

Okta, Inc. is a leading provider of identity and access management (IAM) solutions, serving enterprises globally with secure authentication systems. Its strong revenue growth, cash flow, and leadership in the cybersecurity market make it an attractive acquisition target.



***Key Financial Highlights***

\- Revenue (TTM): $2.45 billion, reflecting 16.2% YoY growth.

\- Profitability:

\- Net Income: -$136 million (improved from -$355 million YoY).

\- EBITDA: -$145 million.

\- Cash Flow Positive: Despite unprofitability, generating $607M in free cash flow.

\- Cash Position: $2.2 billion; current ratio of 1.83 (strong liquidity).

\- Debt Profile: $1.297 billion in total debt; net debt of $820 million (manageable).

\- Market Cap: \~$12–15 billion.

\- Valuation Multiples: Acquisition valuation estimated at $16–18 billion, reflecting 6–9x revenue multiples.



**Strategic Acquisition Rationale**



Market Opportunity

The IAM market is expanding due to hybrid work and zero-trust security models. Okta’s leadership in this high-demand space adds immediate value to acquirers.



Synergies

1. Revenue Synergies:

\- Cross-selling within SaaS, cloud, and cybersecurity ecosystems.

\- Increases customer retention via integrated security offerings.

2. Cost Synergies:

\- Consolidation of R&D, sales, and administrative functions.



**Tax Advantages**

1. Net Operating Losses (NOLs):

\- Okta’s significant NOLs can offset taxable income for the acquirer under U.S. tax rules (IRC Section 382), reducing the acquirer’s overall tax burden.

\- For cash-flow-positive acquirers like *Microsoft* or *Salesforce*, this could be an immediate financial benefit.

2. R&D Tax Credits:

\- Okta’s investment in IAM technology qualifies for R&D tax credits, which the acquirer can leverage to reduce tax liability.

3. Capital Gains Protection:

\- If the acquirer has large realized gains in 2024, purchasing Okta could offset these with acquisition-related costs.



Timing Considerations

2024: Lower valuation; earlier synergies and immediate tax benefits from NOLs.

2025: Higher valuation but lower operational risk as Okta achieves profitability milestones.



**Potential Acquirers and Recommendations**

Acquirer: Microsoft

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Integrates into Azure AD; removes a competitor; strengthens security leadership. Early acquisition maximizes synergies and tax advantages from Okta’s NOLs.



Acquirer: Google (Alphabet)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Conservative M&A approach; IAM complements Google Cloud; may prefer profitability first.



Acquirer: Amazon (AWS)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Less urgent; would act only if Microsoft or others make a move.



Acquirer: Salesforce

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Complements Slack and Salesforce’s SaaS stack; increases enterprise value. Tax advantages can offset acquisition costs while enhancing shareholder value.



Acquirer: Cisco

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Aligns with Cisco’s cybersecurity strategy; enhances subscription revenue growth. Okta’s NOLs can be applied against Cisco’s strong operating profits.



**Valuation and Stock Price Impact**



Acquisition Valuation

2024: $16–18 billion (20–40% premium).

2025: $18–22 billion, assuming profitability.



Stock Price Impact

2024 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $95.81–$107.78 per share.

\- Upside: +29% to +45% (from \~$74.51 current price).



2025 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $107–$130 per share.

\- Upside: +44% to +75%.



**Final Recommendation**



For Acquirers

2024 Acquisition:

\- Microsoft, Salesforce, Cisco: Act now to secure market share, synergies, and tax advantages while Okta is undervalued.



2025 Acquisition:

\- Google, Amazon: Wait for profitability milestones, reducing operational risks.



For Stockholders

Hold the stock for potential 29–75% upside over the next 12–18 months through organic growth or an acquisition.

**Conclusion**

Okta is a prime acquisition target with robust growth potential, strategic synergies, and significant tax advantages for tech giants. While aggressive acquirers like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Cisco should act in 2024 to maximize these benefits, more conservative companies like Google and Amazon may wait until 2025 for improved profitability metrics. Either way, Okta presents a compelling investment with projected stock price increases of $95–$130 per share.

Trying to understand the mechanics/risk of SGOV vs short term treasuries Money Market vs a HYSA and their relative safety.,1gvawfq,FortuneSoul,2024-11-20 04:41:27,12,0.81,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gvawfq/trying_to_understand_the_mechanicsrisk_of_sgov_vs/,"I recently have started using SGOV in my brokerage as a savings account which I pay my bills against to minimize idle cash in low returning accounts.  The returns are between 4.5-5.5% in the recent interest rate markets which is better than my High yield savings account (HYSA) so I basically have discontinued using my HYSA and just use SGOV.  I don't think I fully understand the risk after talking to a Schwab advisor so hoping to get some insight.  For comparison, here are 3 different yet similar investment vehicles that I am comparing:

1. SGOV: an ETF that is 99% invested in ultra short term treasuries; 30 day yield of 4.74%.  High liquidity as I can instantly buy/sell during market hours.  Share price increases throughout the month and then decreases on the 1st when they turn over their bonds and pay the difference in dividends.  Interest is 99% tax free at the state level due to Treasury holdings.
2. MM (SWSBX): a Schwab money market account; 30 day yield of 4.29%.  Schwab acts as middle man and fixes price at $1 per share, uses their resources to ensure stability during chaotic events.  Higher liquidity as money settles in 24 hrs.  Interest is paid directly to the account.  Interest is largely tax free at the state level due to holdings.
3. HYSA: a high yield savings account; 30 day yield of 4.65%.  Bank acts as a middle man with my money, investing it in Treasuries and Bonds and paying me a return.  Benefit: FDIC insurance.  Drawback: slow liquidity if I need to move money around quickly.  Interest is subject to State and Federal taxes.

The Schwab advisor was trying to say that SGOV is not negligible risk because it is an ETF so supply/demand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like S&P500.  He said that this is because it is a closed end traded fund so it has a fixed number of shares that correspond to the projected value of the underlying bonds and therefore is sensitive to rapid shifts in buying and selling to balance the traded price.  Google says it is has an open ended structure same as the money market, so this already seems wrong.  I have noticed certain days I'll have a small (0.05%) loss although it does provide the anticipated 30day yield over the course of the month.  I assumed these minor losses were from buying/selling of the underlying bonds that have mismatched maturity intervals (1 weeks vs 4 week, etc).

It seems to me that there are the following risks:

1. Government / Treasury insolvency: if something like this happens it seems that all 3 of these vehicles are equally in trouble as well as FDIC insurance, so I'm not really concerned about this.
2. ETF Management Fraud: this seems like the main risk, if the SGOV board was committing fraud and not actually allocating 99% of its resources to treasuries.  The risk feels pretty low on this though but it would be unique to SGOV.
3. Return Rate Fluctuation:  If federal interest rates suddenly drop, it seems all 3 vehicles would be equally impacted although some maybe more quickly than others.  Therefore, I'm not really concerned about this either.  This also would only impact future returns not your principle.
4. Black Swan Event:  If something happened like war or pandemic outbreak and a massive shift in outflows occurred, what would happen?  Would SGOV plummet, MM be protected through Schwab backing, and HYSA be unaffected and protected with FDIC?  This is my primary concern.

TLDR:  Is it possible for SGOV return a negative value?  I understand its return is sensitive to underlying short term treasury bond prices but can you lose your principle?",2024-11-20,0.9623,Positive,"['SGOV', 'HYSA', 'HYSA', 'SGOV', 'SGOV', 'ETF', 'MM', 'SWSBX', 'HYSA', 'FDIC', 'SGOV', 'ETF', 'FDIC', 'ETF', 'SGOV', 'SGOV', 'SGOV', 'MM', 'HYSA', 'FDIC', 'TLDR', 'SGOV']"
"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones",1gv9g66,Puginator,2024-11-20 03:38:46,181,0.95,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gv9g66/qualcomm_says_it_expects_4_billion_in_pc_chip/,"Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.

Of that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.

The latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm’s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.

Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.

*″*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,” Amon said at the investor event.

Another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.

Qualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.

Qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running Google Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to Apple for its iPhones.

But the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.

Qualcomm’s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.

“We put a strategy in ’21, and we’re not changing our strategy,” Amon said.

Laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.

“The competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,” Amon said, referring to Apple’s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. “We saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.”

The forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including Meta for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an “edge AI” company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that’s typically powered by Nvidia processors. Company officials didn’t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.

Qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that’s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.

“What you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.

"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value",1gv6hj0,Illustrious_Beach,2024-11-20 01:34:07,76,0.72,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gv6hj0/palantir_short_thesis_and_an_analysis_of_its/,"Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. I recognize that this is /r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone's risk profile. I hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

*2021 peak enterprise value:* $60B at around $37 per share  
*17/11/2024 enterprise value:* $146B at around $64 per share

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). The leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. Thus, I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

I believe that Uber could easily survive mass adoptions of Autonomous Vehicles if they simply pivot to becoming the platform provider  this could be quite profitable for Uber and see their expenses come down greatly, as they no longer need to worry about paying for drivers. Uber currently sits at 4.10 FCF Yield (2.83% if you factor in SBC), and is growing FCF's at over a 100% YTD and Revenue 20% YTD. This is a rapidly growing company that's priced quite cheaply, and I believe that the downfall of UBER is greatly exagerated. If Uber can position themselves and continue their relationship with Waymo to be the platform provider, I think they're positioned very well for the adoption of Autonomous Vehicles.

The talks between the two sides are ongoing and, if successful, a deal could be signed in the coming weeks, the sources said.

Sony already has a 2% stake in Kadokawa and a stake in Kadokawa controlled FromSoftware, the developer of the hit fantasy action role-playing game.

Kadokawa is a huge player in Japan. I would say this is almost the equivalent of Disney buying Fox in the West.

Super Micro hires new auditor to maintain Nasdaq listing; shares pop 23%,1gukbfk,Puginator,2024-11-19 06:01:43,255,0.94,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gukbfk/super_micro_hires_new_auditor_to_maintain_nasdaq/,"Embattled server maker Super Micro Computer said on Monday that it’s hired BDO as its new auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq detailing its efforts to regain compliance with the exchange. The shares jumped 23% in extended trading.

“This is an important next step to bring our financial statements current, an effort we are pursuing with both diligence and urgency,” Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a statement.

Super Micro is late in filing its 2024 year-end report with the SEC, and said earlier this month that it was looking for a new accountant after its previous auditor, Ernst & Young, stepped down in October. Ernst & Young was new to the job, having just replaced Deloitte & Touche as Super Micro’s accounting firm in March 2023.

Super Micro said it told Nasdaq that it believes it will be able to file its annual report for the year ended June 30, and quarterly report for the period ended Sept. 30. The company said it will remain listed on the Nasdaq pending the exchange’s “review of the compliance plan.”

Shares of Super Micro soared more than twentyfold over a two year period from early 2022 until their peak in March of this year. But the stock has been hammered on troubling news about its compliance with Nasdaq. Once valued at about $70 billion, the company’s market cap was at $12.6 billion at the close on Monday, following a 16% rally during regular trading.

Super Micro has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, due to its relationship with Nvidia. Sales last fiscal year more than doubled to $15 billion.

On Monday, Super Micro announced that it was selling products featuring Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip called Blackwell. The company competes with vendors like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in packaging up Nvidia AI chips for other companies to access.

Super Micro was added to the S&P 500 in March, reflecting its rapidly growing business and then-soaring stock price. Less than two weeks after the index changes were announced, Super Micro reached its closing high of $118.81.

The troubles began within months. In August, Super Micro said it wouldn’t file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company, and said in a report that it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.” The Wall Street Journal later reported that the Department of Justice was at the early stages of a probe into the company.

The month after announcing its report delay, Super Micro said it had received a notification from the Nasdaq, indicating that the delay in the filing of its annual report meant the company wasn’t in compliance with the exchange’s listing rules. Super Micro said the Nasdaq’s rules allowed the company 60 days to file its report or submit a plan to regain compliance. Based on that timeframe, the deadline was Monday.

My Due Diligence / Research for McDonald's Corporation (MCD)



**1. Fundamental Analysis:**

**a) Valuation:**

\- Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio: Currently at 25.5x, which is higher than the industry average of 23.2x, suggesting potential overvaluation.

\- Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio: At 8.2x, significantly higher than the industry average of 3.1x, indicating the stock may be priced too aggressively relative to its sales.



**b) Revenue Growth:**

\- McDonald's revenue growth has been sluggish in recent years, with a 5-year average growth rate of just 0.8%.

\- The company faces increasing competition from fast-casual dining options and changing consumer preferences toward healthier food choices.



**c) Margin Pressure:**

\- Rising labor costs and commodity prices are putting pressure on McDonald's profit margins.

\- The company's operating margin has remained relatively flat over the past few years, suggesting limited ability to improve profitability.



**d) Debt Levels:**

\- McDonald's has a high debt-to-equity ratio of 3.17, which is significantly above the industry average of 1.2.

\- This high leverage increases the company's financial risk and may limit its ability to invest in growth initiatives or weather economic downturns.



**e) Market Saturation:**

\- McDonald's has limited room for expansion in developed markets, where it already has a significant presence.

\- Growth in emerging markets may be challenging due to local competition and changing consumer preferences.



**2. Technical Analysis:**

**a) Trend Analysis:**

\- The stock has been in an uptrend for an extended period, potentially setting up for a reversal.

\- The 50-day moving average is showing signs of flattening, which could indicate a loss of momentum.



**b) Relative Strength Index (RSI):**

\- The RSI is currently near overbought territory (above 70), suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback.



**c) Volume Analysis:**

\- Recent trading volume has been below average, indicating a lack of conviction in the current uptrend.



**d) Support and Resistance:**

\- The stock is approaching a significant resistance level, which could act as a ceiling for further price appreciation.



**Conclusion:**



There are several factors  mentioned above, that suggest McDonald's stock (MCD) could be a potential short candidate:



1. The stock appears overvalued based on traditional valuation metrics.

2. The company faces challenges in revenue growth and margin expansion.

3. High debt levels increase financial risk.

4. Limited growth opportunities in developed markets and challenges in emerging markets.

5. Technical indicators suggest a potential trend reversal and loss of momentum.



However, it's important to note that McDonald's is a well-established company with a strong brand and global presence. Short positions carry inherent risks, and any trading decision should be made in the context of a well-diversified portfolio and with careful consideration of individual risk tolerance.

There are some notable short term challenges, including

   * Decreased revenues from COVID-19 vaccines.
      * For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were €1.56 billion, down from €2.34 billion in the same period in 2023
   * Net losses due to high R&D spending.
      * The company achieved a net profit of €198.1 million in Q3 2024, compared to €160.6 million in Q3 2023. However, for the first nine months of 2024, BioNTech reported a net loss of €924.8 million, a significant decrease from the €472.4 million net profit in the same period last year.
   * Uncertainties in clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals.
      * FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Phase 3 NSCLC trial due to varying results.
      * The partial FDA clinical hold on BNT316/ONC-392 and the COVID-19-influenza combination vaccine not meeting all primary endpoints are notable challenges.

Now, there are many long term potencials:

* A robust and diverse pipeline with multiple candidates in late-stage trials.
   * Phase 1: 26 drugs currently in this stage; Phase 2: 13 drugs in this phase; Phase 3: 4 drugs in this final stage.
* Strong financial reserves to support ongoing development.
   * BioNTech maintains a strong cash position with €17.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and security investments as of September 30, 2024.
* Strategic shift towards high-growth areas like oncology and personalized medicine.
   * Initiated two Phase 2 trials in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
   * Planning Phase 3 trials based on Phase 2 outcomes.
   * Presented encouraging data in advanced TNBC, EGFR-mutated NSCLC, and renal cell carcinoma at ESMO 2024.

To raise a question, I have little expertise in biology myself and I deem the company's ability to bring new products to market successfully will be a critical factor in its future performance.

McDonald’s is ramping its AI efforts back up and all signs point to SoundHound AI as their next major partner. Their recent job posting for a Director of AI Engineering focuses on integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) into existing systems, rather than building proprietary solutions from scratch. This aligns perfectly with SoundHound’s expertise in conversational AI and their dominance in the foodservice sector. Notably, McDonald’s previously ended its AI collaboration with IBM, leaving room for a more specialized partner to enhance its drive-thru, kiosk, and mobile ordering systems.

Adding fuel to the speculation, SoundHound recently announced on their earnings call that they’ve secured a major new client in the restaurant industry—one they are not yet able to name and negotiating with others. Given McDonald’s history of partnering with established tech leaders like Dynamic Yield and the timing of this hiring, it’s hard not to connect the dots.

TSLA +5% overnight due to this news.

  
(Bloomberg) -- Members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department’s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter.

If new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect’s inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.

Current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

While the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.

One candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump’s team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said. 

Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.

The transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Musk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk’s plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment. 

He supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, saying he’d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc.

Trump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to “dismantle government bureaucracy” and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.

Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled.

NHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.

A bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump’s first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.",2024-11-18,0.7783,Positive,"['TSLA', 'EV', 'US', 'NHTSA']"

My research and direction of ABNB,1gtrdjh,_punter_,2024-11-18 05:24:52,78,0.95,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gtrdjh/my_research_and_direction_of_abnb/,"Hi Everyone,

Putting a disclaimer here before people come and flame me.

I am from the tech industry with a major in data modelling and have spent the last 15 years of my time trading, investing and sharing my research with my close circle of friends. Some picks bombed rightaway and my friends relying on my research lost a shitton of money, a very small portion were really good wins  but their overall portfolio indeed is still in the green.

So based on their push( and possibly for my validation too), I have decided to post my research here so that the wider community can support the research or find holes in it. Either way, this would help me make it better everytime. Also I trade as well as invest a lot via options, so at any point of time, I might be holding a long or a short position on the stocks I reseach.

I am based out of Melbourne, Australia and use IBKR and TastyTrade for trading in US markets.

I do technical analysis too but to be honest I do not rely on technical indicators much but rather  I rely on my data modeling background to find what the data is telling me. Whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued or worth its current evalation. None of the companies that I pick to trade(go long/short) are a quick trades. Usually my trades bear fruit in 3 to 4 months or sometime much longer. Hence I use the options way. No complex options techniques but just a simple call/put to enter with low capital and stay in longer than I could afford if I had gone the cash way.

I spent a lot of time last week evaluating AirBNB stock and my numbers show that its a short as stock which should keep on declining till the next results in Feb 2025. Then the numbers that come out in Feb 2025 should decide the fate from then onwards. Anything after that would be a speculation.

Based on my  analysis of Airbnb's financial performance, market position, and the industry trend I recommend a short position on ABNB stock. While the company has shown impressive growth and resilience, several factors suggest potential downside risk in the near to medium term.

As with any data modelling, I have also posted the risk of this analysis at the end as to why this modelling could fail and please read this in its entirety before you take any action. And please note, this is not financial advise but just my research based on me looking to take a position on a stock. Feel free to enter a long or short position based on what you infer from the data points below.

As for me, I would be entering a short position when the market opens today(18th Nov).

**Financial and Fundamental Analysis:**

**1. Valuation Concerns:**  
Airbnb's current valuation appears stretched, with a forward P/E ratio of approximately 35x (as of the last reporting date), significantly higher than the industry average. This premium valuation leaves little room for error and may not be sustainable in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

**2. Slowing Growth:**  
While Airbnb has demonstrated strong revenue growth since its IPO, the rate of growth is decelerating. Year-over-year revenue growth has slowed from triple-digit percentages in 2021 to more modest double-digit growth in recent quarters. This trend may continue as the company faces tougher year-over-year comparisons and market saturation in key regions.

**3. Regulatory Headwinds:**  
Airbnb continues to face regulatory challenges in various markets worldwide. Cities like New York, Barcelona, and Amsterdam have implemented stricter regulations on short-term rentals, which could impact Airbnb's inventory and revenue potential in these key markets.

**4. Increasing Competition:**  
The short-term rental market is becoming increasingly competitive, with traditional hotel chains expanding their offerings and new entrants like Vrbo (Expedia Group) gaining market share. This intensifying competition may pressure Airbnb's margins and market position.

**5. Macroeconomic Uncertainties:**  
The travel industry is sensitive to economic conditions. With concerns about inflation, potential recession, and geopolitical tensions, consumer discretionary spending on travel may decrease, negatively impacting Airbnb's bookings and revenue.

**6. Profitability Concerns:**  
While Airbnb has recently achieved profitability, its margins remain thin. The company's efforts to expand into new markets and services may put pressure on profitability in the short to medium term.

**Technical Analysis:**

**1. Bearish Trend:**  
The stock has been in a downtrend since its peak in February 2021, forming lower highs and lower lows. This suggests persistent selling pressure and a lack of sustained bullish momentum.

**2. Moving Average Crossover:**  
The 50-day moving average has recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, forming a ""death cross."" This bearish signal often precedes further downside in the stock price.

**3. Resistance Levels:**  
ABNB stock has consistently failed to break through key resistance levels, indicating strong selling pressure at higher prices.

**4. Relative Strength Index (RSI):**  
The RSI has been trending downward and has struggled to break above the 60 level in recent months, suggesting weakness in buying momentum.

**5. Volume Analysis:**  
Recent rallies have occurred on relatively low volume, while sell-offs have seen higher volume. This pattern suggests that selling pressure remains dominant.

**Risks to Short Thesis:**

**1. Innovation and New Revenue Streams:**  
Airbnb's continued focus on product innovation and expansion into new services could drive unexpected growth and improve investor sentiment.

**2. Travel Industry Recovery:**  
A stronger-than-expected rebound in global travel could boost Airbnb's bookings and revenue, potentially leading to positive earnings surprises.

**3. Margin Improvement:**  
If Airbnb can significantly improve its operating margins through cost-cutting measures or increased efficiency, it could lead to better-than-expected profitability.

**Conclusion:**  
While Airbnb remains a leader in the short-term rental market with a strong brand and global presence, the combination of stretched valuation, slowing growth, regulatory challenges, and bearish technical indicators suggests potential downside risk. I would be initiating a short position in ABNB stock using either a March or April 2025 PUT option, with close monitoring of the identified risks to the short thesis.

>  
WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump) has selected Chris Wright, a campaign donor and fossil fuel executive, to serve as energy secretary in his upcoming, second administration.

>CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, Wright is a vocal advocate of [oil and gas development](https://apnews.com/hub/oil-and-gas-industry), including fracking, a key pillar of Trump’s quest to achieve U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market.

>Wright has been one of the industry’s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change and could give fossil fuels a boost, including quick action to end [a year-long pause on natural gas export approvals](https://apnews.com/article/lng-exports-biden-europe-climate-russia-3c2bfd853c0d53531a677b142b009dbc) by the Biden administration.

>Wright also has criticized what he calls a “top-down” approach to climate by liberal and left-wing groups and said the climate movement around the world is “collapsing under its own weight.” Wright, who has never served in government, has written that more fossil fuel production is needed around the globe to lift people out of poverty.

>Consideration of Wright to head the administration's energy department won support from influential conservatives, including oil and gas tycoon Harold Hamm.

>Hamm, executive chairman of Oklahoma-based Continental Resources, a major shale oil company, is a longtime Trump supporter and adviser who played a key role on energy issues in Trump’s first term. Hamm helped organize an event at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in April where Trump reportedly asked industry leaders and lobbyists to [donate $1 billion to Trump’s campaign](https://apnews.com/article/schumer-democrats-big-oil-price-fixing-collusion-07a8583a2b12e645d2860608c626cc7c), with the expectation that Trump would curtail environmental regulations if reelected.

>Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's top lobbying group, said Wright’s experience in the energy sector “gives him an important perspective that will inform his leadership"" of the Energy Department.

>“We look forward to working with him once confirmed to bolster American geopolitical strength by lifting DOE’s pause on LNG export permits and ensuring the open access of American energy for our allies around the world,"" Sommers said.

>Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called Wright “a champion of dirty fossil fuels"" and said his nomination to lead the Energy Department was “a disastrous mistake.”

>“The Energy Department should be doing all it can to develop and expand the energy sources of the 21st century, not trying to promote the dirty fuels of the last century,"" Wong said. “Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE’s core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever.""

Assuming Wright is approved, what will be the short and long term impacts to the energy market in the United States?

Second if he does take the position its not going to stop or delay any current R&D, if anything it may speed up the approval process making it more efficient with less bureaucracy.

PENN - Anybody seeing this? Weekly crossed the 50-Day for first time in 3 years...,1gsc4ue,notbutterface,2024-11-16 06:52:31,37,0.87,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gsc4ue/penn_anybody_seeing_this_weekly_crossed_the_50day/,"The 8- and 21-day MA's just crossed over the 50-day on the weekly chart for the first time since 2021. This seems like a significant milestone for a stock that has been beaten down since it's failure with Barstool during the meme-stock craze.

You can see my other posts for a more in-depth thesis, but some recent news worth mentioning plus a conspiracy theory:

* Stock is up 30% in the past 6 months, yet \~15% short interest of float. 
* Q3 EPS beat, Rev didn't. Lower promo expenses. Lower losses in OSB than expected. Market share not where we want, but path to profitability is improving.
* Former Disney CTO joined the company. As a reminder, Disney owns ESPN so I see this as more buy-in from the Disney team. 
* Greenlight Capital increased their stake, it is now their 6th largest holding. Einhorn said ""we believe the market ascribes a substantial negative value to \[their OSB business\]"". And thinks OSB could add $20 per share of value.
* ESPN --- ESPN Bet account linking allows the app to know your favorite sports and fantasy team so it can create personalized bets/marketing for users. Shows further integration with Disney.
* Finally launched in NYC, mixed results for now. 
* Multiple analysts initiate coverage, showing it is a player worth tracking. Mixed opinions.

One big deal that no one talks about here is that Disney currently has $500M in warrants to purchase PENN stock. If I remember correctly, their agreement was for 3 years; if Disney doesn't like ESPN Bet's performance then they can pull the plug. Well we just crossed Year 1 and Disney's CTO has now joined PENN, they're linking ESPN accounts, they're seeing fewer losses than expected, and by 2026 (year 3) PENN believes they will have ""meaningful free cash flow"" from OSB. I have a very hard time believing that Disney would rather go through the headache of ripping out all of their integrations with PENN to find a new provider. Like the sunk cost there would be massive and why would they? The just want a faceless tech/casino provider so that they can put their own brand as the name. Fanduel/DraftKings/MGM, all of those would want their own names on the app. 

Additionally, and maybe this really gets to the tinfoil hat (I don't think it's as crazy as you might), why wouldn't Disney acquire more PENN stock? It's one of the cheapest casino operators out there right now, sports betting is becoming more mainstream (and palatable for DIS investors), and they get more upside if this thing takes off? The market for OSB continues to grow as more states legalize it and they have a massive opportunity to gain market share. Why wouldn't they want more of that upside?

Look, I've been DCA-ing into PENN over the past year, so do I want this to be right? Absolutely. But there just seem to be way too many tailwinds popping up for this valuation to make any sense with even a remotely successful ESPN Bet. DraftKings has been significantly more unprofitable ever since launching their app in 2018 and trades at 5.0x their Rev, but when PENN is negative it trades at 0.5x (other valuation methods show similar)?

Yeah I don't see that lasting, so I'll buy more.

Net income came in 43.9 billion Chinese yuan ($6.07 billion), compared with a LSEG outlook of 25.83 billion yuan.

Revenue reached 236.5 billion yuan ($32.72 billion), versus an analyst forecast of 238.9 billion yuan, according to LSEG data.

The company’s New York-listed shares have gained ground this year to date, up almost 17% as of Friday. The stock was up 3% in premarket trading at 11:43 a.m. London time, after the release of the quarterly earnings.

The results come at a tricky time for Chinese commerce businesses, given a tepid retail environment that reflects broader sluggishness in the world’s second-largest economy.

Markets are now watching whether a slew of recent stimulus measures from Beijing, including a five-year 1.4-trillion-yuan package announced last week, will help resuscitate the country’s growth and curtail a long-lived real estate market slump.

The impact on the retail space looks promising so far, with sales rising by a better-than-expected 4.8% year-on-year in October, while China’s recent Singles’ Day shopping holiday — widely seen as a barometer for national consumer sentiment — regained some of its luster.

Alibaba touted “robust growth” in gross merchandise volume — an industry measure of sales over time that does not equate to the company’s revenue — for its Taobao and Tmall Group businesses during the festival, along with a “record number of active buyers.”

“Alibaba’s outlook remains closely aligned with the trajectory of the Chinese economy and evolving regulatory policies,” ING analysts said Thursday, noting that the company’s Friday report will shed light on the Chinese economy’s growth momentum.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Naive question: Intel 18A--what could go wrong?,1grrx4w,ultrapcb,2024-11-15 14:02:29,10,0.73,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1grrx4w/naive_question_intel_18awhat_could_go_wrong/,"\[Disclosure: not invested in Intel yet but thinking about doing so\]

Ok, we know Intel messed up and whatever but what I do not get (so please challenge my train of thoughts):

* Intel got newest machines from ASML last year
* They use them for 18A
* Like TSMC does for AMD, Apple, etc.
* Lunar Lake is a combo of Intel's design skills and TSMC's/ASML's fab skills
* But with low margins because of latter
* However, Lunar Lake turned out pretty good, so Intel's design skills are def there
* And with 18A, Intel will have everything in-house

So, what could go wrong? Maybe Intel need quite some time to catch up and have the same fab capacity based on ASML machines but we will get there at some point.

The competition? AMD will have (long-term!) lower margins b/c of TSMC (also slower time-to-market, lower quantities), Qualcomm has lower compat and needs still to resort issues with ARM, Nvidia while capable will need some time and will have a good offer but they won't have a fab either and will face compat issues like Qualcomm. Not saying that these are dealbreakers but yeah...

What does speak against Intel: org is too messed to get it ever restructured and/or reorg too expensive, running out of money (but gov money), time, building fabs needs years, zero EUV experience, low yields for years

Edit: Intel has a lower market cap than AMD despite AMD just having design in-house, they have more assets in the GPU department but it is insignificant compared to something like Nvidia and if we talk about IGPUs Intel seem to be on par

Edit2: Would at least a new CEO just give us a bump, so we could leave again with some short-term gains?

Deep dive into Cal-Maine - Cracking the shell: The complex World of Eggs,1grey27,k_ristovski,2024-11-15 02:22:11,29,0.91,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1grey27/deep_dive_into_calmaine_cracking_the_shell_the/,"**1.0 Introduction**

Every once in a while, I stumble upon a company that seems simple, yet, turns out to be incredibly complex. Cal-Maine is one that fits this description.

It is the largest producer and distributor of shell eggs in the U.S. (market share of \~14.5%), and its closest competitor is almost half its size.

Based on the description, one would expect that this is a relatively simple company. I mean, **it only sells eggs, right?**

What if I told you that the management has very little control over a business of this kind? There’s a lot to unpack, so let’s get started.

  
**2.0 The eggs**

In theory, the revenue generated would be equal to the **number of eggs sold** multiplied by the **average egg price**. So let’s have a look at these two variables:

Cal-Maine sells two types of eggs:

* **Specialty** \- These encompass a broad range of products, such as cage-free, organic, brown, free-range, pasture-raised, and nutritionally enhanced eggs.
* **Conventional** \- all other shell eggs

Why is this important? The specialty eggs are typically sold at prices and terms negotiated directly with customers. Unlike conventional, where the wholesale prices are volatile.

In 2024, the company sold 12% more dozens than back in 2018. This is more impressive than it sounds, as this is not a growing market. The demand for eggs is relatively stable, in fact, and it only grows with an increase in population. This indicates the company has slightly increased its market share during this time. To illustrate how stable the sales were in terms of volume, the 12% increase from 2018 to 2024 came without any down year.

But more importantly, the composition has changed. In 2018, about 244m dozens of specialty eggs were sold. This number increased to 401m in 2024 (**+64%**)! The % of specialty eggs of the total eggs sold increased from 24% to 35%.

Here are the prices from 2018 to 2024:

Conventional: $1.23 --> $1.04 --> $0.98 --> $0.98 --> $1.42 --> $2.73 --> $1.73

Specialty: $1.92 --> $1.93 --> $1.88 --> $1.88 --> $1.93 --> $2.40 --> 2.31

The specialty eggs are not only more expensive, but the price is significantly more stable.  Well, except for 2023. What was that about? Why were conventional eggs more expensive?

The answer is **HPAI**, known as “**Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza**” which is deadly to domestic poultry and can wipe out entire flocks within a matter of days. When there is an HPAI outbreak, there is a significant decrease in supply, which pushes the price up. This is unpredictable, and the only way to deal with this is to mitigate the risk by having multiple locations, something that Cal-Maine has.

  
The volatility of egg prices ***(per dozen)*** is significant, so despite the volume of dozens sold being stable, it is impossible to forecast the revenue of the company over time, given the volatility of the prices. But this is just the start.



**3.0 The direct costs**

The largest direct cost relates to feed. The vast majority of the corn and soybeans are purchased from suppliers in the U.S. and there is quite some volatility.

**So the management isn’t in control of the costs, nor the revenue.** That is a tough position to be in.

This is exactly why the financials are all over the place, despite the stable sales from a volume point of view.

Over the last decade:

\- The gross margin has fluctuated between **12% and 38%.**

\- The operating margin has fluctuated between **-2% and 31%.**

  
**4.0 Now what?**

So, what can the management do? Not much, other than being prepared for a bad year, as it is only a matter of time before that happens.

For that reason, the company has **no debt**.

In addition, its dividend policy is defined in relation to its profitability. The quarterly dividend payout is 1/3rd of its quarterly net income. This is definitely reasonable. Where does the remaining cash go to?

* **Acquisitions** \- There have been a total of 24 acquisitions, ranging from 160,000 to 7.5m layers.
* **Investment securities** \- Mostly U.S. Government and agency obligations, corporate bonds, and commercial paper.

I do think that the management does a good job, but the uncertainty scares away many investors.

  
**5.0 Other important topics**

**5.1 Walmart**

About 89% of the total revenue relates to sales to retail customers and 11% to food service providers.

**Walmart (including Sam’s Club)** is a major customer, accounting for 34% of its revenue. Although this might be perceived as a risk by many, I’d argue that is one of the biggest strengths the company has. Walmart has no alternative, as no competitor can quickly jump in to replace Cal-Maine.

**5.2 The special shares**

The company has two types of shares:

* **Common** (trading on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol $CALM- 44.2m shares outstanding
* **Class A** \- 4.8m shares outstanding, owned by an LLC

So, why are there two types of shares? Although both of them have the same rights in terms of dividends and liquidation, each class A shares is entitled to **10 votes.**

This means the class A shareholders have **52% voting rights.**

**6.0 Valuation**

So, how does one value a company of this kind when not only there are many pieces of the puzzle, but the pieces are changing?

Does a DCF make sense? Not really. There is no point attempting to forecast the next 5 or 10 years, when the next 2 are uncertain.

I’d argue that this is a company that could be treated like a bond, where the coupon is fluctuating, and a dividend discount model would be an appropriate way to value it. Except, instead of using the dividend, I’ll use FCF - SBC.

  
So, how to estimate the FCF? There will always be good and bad years in a company of this kind. So using the average of the last decade would be a good place to start.

  
FCF - SBC: $180m

Growth in perpetuity: 8%

Discount rate: 9%

Value of the business: $3 billion

\+ Cash: $182m

\+ Non-operating assets: $539m

\- Value of equity options: $12

**Value of the company: $3.7 billion ($76/share)**

This is slightly lower than the current market cap of **$4.6 billion ($91/share)**.



So, anyone who is betting on Cal-Maine is ultimately betting that:

1. The egg market will remain stable, from a volume point of view - **which is very likely**
2. The future prices (eggs, corn, soybeans) will be slightly more favorable on average than the past prices - **which is uncertain**
3. Walmart will remain a key customer - **which is likely**
4. There will be no significant HPAI outbreak that will harm Cal-Maine - **which is uncertain**
5. The class A shareholders votes will be in the interest of all shareholders - given the past decisions, **this is likely**
6. The management will continue to run the company safely, without any significant debt position - **which is likely**

Based on the list above, there are two uncertainties, prices and HPAI outbreaks. Quite a lot to digest, for such a “simple” business. It’s only eggs, right?

I hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts.

Sole awardee of Near Space Network (NSN) data services contract from NASA with a maximum potential value of $4.82 billion, a transformative step for Intuitive Machines in data transmission for in-space communications and navigation


Completed vehicle propulsion system hot fire for Intuitive Machines’ second lunar mission, representing the most complex integrated test of the vehicle, in preparation for a Q1 launch from the Kennedy Space Center


Achieved $58.5 million of revenue in Q3, up 359% YoY; $173.3 million year to date, more than double all of 2023


Improved profitability with $4.1 million of positive gross margin in Q3


Ended Q3 with $89.6 million in cash, the highest quarter ending cash balance in Company history


Reported record backlog of $316.2 million, the highest quarter ending backlog in Company history driven primarily by Intuitive Machines’ fourth NASA CLPS award; backlog does not yet include the full $150 million of initial task orders for Near Space Network data services


Mr. Altemus continued, “We made progress across all three pillars by first securing another south pole lunar delivery mission, then winning the Near Space Network Services contract, and finally, continuing to mature both our LTV design in conjunction with our heavy cargo class lander. These strategic revenue streams bring our business thesis clearly into view, allowing us to focus on capturing more operational services, which we believe will provide long-tail revenues with higher margins.”

Intuitive Machines CFO Pete McGrath said, “As demonstrated in the quarter, we continue to execute on current programs while winning key awards. I look forward to guiding the Company through a new lens as CFO and focus on managing costs efficiently to drive towards profitability and achieve our financial targets.”

Disney narrowly beats estimates as streaming boosts entertainment segment,1gr3mpb,Puginator,2024-11-14 17:56:32,102,0.89,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gr3mpb/disney_narrowly_beats_estimates_as_streaming/,"Disney reported its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Thursday, narrowly beating analyst estimates as streaming growth helped propel its entertainment segment. 

Here is what Disney reported compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG

Earnings per share: $1.14 adjusted vs. $1.10 expected

Revenue: $22.57 billion vs. $22.45 billion expected

Disney’s net income increased to $460 million, or 25 cents per share, from $264 million, or 14 cents per share, during the same quarter last year. Adjusting for one-time items, including restructuring and impairment charges, Disney reported earnings per share of $1.14. 

Total segment operating income increased 23% to $3.66 billion compared with the same period in 2023.  

Revenue for the entertainment segment – which includes the traditional TV networks,  direct-to-consumer streaming and films – increased 14% year over year to $10.83 billion after a hot summer at the box office.

Disney Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” became the highest-grossing animated movie of all time this summer, surpassing Disney’s “Frozen II” at the box office. Meanwhile, its “Deadpool & Wolverine” became the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, surpassing Warner Bros. Discovery’s “Joker.”

The films added $316 million of profit for the entertainment segment during the quarter. Overall, the entertainment segment reported nearly $1.1 billion in profit.

Revenue for Disney’s sports segment, made up primarily of ESPN, was flat. ESPN’s profit fell 6% due in part to higher programming costs associated with U.S. college football rights as well as fewer customers in the cable bundle. 

Disney’s combined streaming business, which includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, saw profitability improve during the quarter after turning its first profit during the fiscal third quarter, three months earlier than expected. The division reported an operating income of $321 million for the September period compared with a loss of $387 million during the same period last year. 

Disney joined its peers, including Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, Comcast and Paramount Global in adding streaming subscribers during the most recent quarter. 

Disney+ Core subscribers – which excludes Disney+ Hotstar in India and other countries in the region – grew by 4.4 million, or 4%, to 122.7 million. Hulu subscribers grew 2% to 52 million. 

Average revenue per user for domestic Disney+ customers dropped from $7.74 to $7.70, as the company had a higher mix of customers on its cheaper, ad-supported tier and wholesale offerings. 

Meanwhile the company’s traditional TV networks business continued to decline as consumers leave pay TV bundles behind in favor of streaming. Revenue for the networks was down 6% to $2.46 billion. Profit for the segment sank 38% to $498 million. 

The experiences segment, which includes Disney’s theme parks as well as consumer products, saw revenue grow 1% to $8.24 billion. 

The domestic parks’ operating income rose 5% to $847 million, helped by higher guest spending at the parks and cruise lines. 

Operating income at the international parks, however, fell 32% due to a decline in attendance and in guest spending as well as increased costs. 

The company said Thursday it’s “confident in the long-term prospects for the business,” and provided an outlook that includes its fiscal 2025, 2026 and 2027.

Disney expects a “modest decline” in Disney+ Core subscribers during the fiscal first quarter of 2025 compared with the prior quarter.

Full-year profit in the entertainment streaming business, which excludes ESPN+, is expected to see an increase of roughly $875 million compared to the prior fiscal year and to increase by a double digit percentage in its fiscal 2026.

Disney also anticipates double-digit percentage growth in fiscal 2025 for its entertainment segment.

The experience segment, however, is expected to see just 6% to 8% profit growth in the coming fiscal year compared to the prior year. Disney noted the fiscal first quarter will see a $130 million hit due to the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, as well as a $90 million impact from Disney Cruise Line pre-launch costs.

During Disney’s fiscal 2025, the company expects high-single digit adjusted earnings growth compared to the prior fiscal year. The company expects double digit adjusted EPS growth in both fiscal 2026 and 2027.

Why do shareholders of a company with positive shareholder equity still receive nothing in the event of bankruptcy?,1gqtwgt,maximalsimplicity,2024-11-14 07:25:30,55,0.76,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqtwgt/why_do_shareholders_of_a_company_with_positive/,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently looking at the situation with Spirit Airlines. I’m not a shareholder, but I was interested in the fact that they report about $807m in shareholder equity.

Spirit now claim that the bonds due in 2025 and 2026 are a problem, and they must renegotiate, likely resulting in a wipeout of shareholders and Chapter 11.

My question is, if the company has equity value remaining, why do the shareholders end up with nothing? Is it because the value of those assets would likely not stack up to the value of liabilities when liquidated/sold off (although I would assume depreciation accounts for that)? Or is it because the costs incurred during the bankruptcy process would exceed the shareholder equity in the company?

I can’t imagine the process would cost them $807m…

After some extensive research I landed on these 4 industries: robotics, cyber-security, beverages and industrial. 

The four companies I landed on were SYM, S, BROS, and ATMU. 

Symbiotic, $SYM is a robotic warehouse company located in Massachusetts. Its number one customer is Walmart and is also partnered with Target, Unfi. They are showing strong revenue growth and on the verge of positive net income. At 20 billion dollars it seems fairly valued when compared to other robotics companies like ABB which has a 100 billion dollar market cap. I think SYM has the opportunity to take some more of their market share. 

$S, SentinelOne, is a cyber-security company worth roughly 9 billion dollars. It can be compared to Cloudflare and Palo Alto. At about a quarter of the valuation, there is a lot of room for growth. 

$BROS, Dutch Bros is a coffee / beverage company that has been expanding like wild fire. It opened over 30 new shops last quarter. And just popped 30% after last earnings. I believe this company is on a similar trajectory as Starbucks, and seems to have even more momentum than Starbucks, Gen Z is obsessed with their drinks and the line is always very long. A risky growth play, but intriguing. 

$ATMU is a water filtration company valued at 3.6 billion and has a PE of 20 and has growing revenue and net income. A strong value play in my opinion, and very highly regarded by analysts. Seemed like a no brainer to me. 

Would love to hear your opinions on the stocks, and would like to know if you have better options in these 4 industries. I opened a small position today in these 4 stocks. ",2024-11-14,0.9916,Positive,"['SYM', 'BROS', 'ATMU', 'SYM', 'ABB', 'SYM', 'BROS', 'ATMU', 'PE']"
Cisco reports fourth straight quarter of declining revenue,1gqoqlz,Puginator,2024-11-14 03:25:40,92,0.92,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqoqlz/cisco_reports_fourth_straight_quarter_of/,"Cisco reported a fourth straight quarter of declining revenue even as results topped analysts’ estimates. The stock slipped about 1% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** 91 cents adjusted vs. 87 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $13.84 billion vs. $13.77 billion expected

Cisco’s revenue dropped 6% in the quarter ended Oct. 26, from $14.7 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. Net income fell to $2.71 billion, or 68 cents per share, from $3.64 billion, or 89 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

Networking revenue plunged 23% to $6.75 billion, slightly below the $6.8 billion consensus of analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

Security revenue doubled to $2.02 billion, topping the StreetAccount consensus of $1.93 billion. Cisco’s revenue from collaboration was $1.09 billion, a bit below the $1.04 billion consensus estimate.

Chuck Robbins, Cisco’s CEO, said on a Wednesday conference call that orders from large-scale clients for artificial intelligence infrastructure exceeded $300 million in the quarter. Server makers such as Dell and HPE have also focused on sales of hardware that can help clients implement generative AI.

“We have earned more design wins and remain confident that we will exceed our target of $1 billion of AI orders this fiscal year from web-scale customers,” Robbins said.

U.S. government agencies have delayed deals with Cisco, rather than scrapping them altogether, Robbins said.

During the quarter, Cisco acquired security startups DeepFactor and Robust Intelligence.

Cisco lifted its full-year guidance to $3.60 to $3.66 in adjusted earnings per share on $55.3 billion to $56.3 billion in revenue, up from a prior forecast of $3.52 to $3.58 in EPS and $55 billion to $56.2 billion in revenue. Guidance would indicate projected revenue growth of 3.3% at the middle of the range.

Analysts expected adjusted earnings for the year of $3.58 per share on $55.89 billion in revenue.

As of Wednesday’s close, Cisco’s stock was up 17% year to date, while the S&P 500 index, is up around 26% over that stretch.

"AMD to lay off 4% of workforce, or about 1,000 employees",1gqonzv,Puginator,2024-11-14 03:22:30,713,0.97,148,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqonzv/amd_to_lay_off_4_of_workforce_or_about_1000/,"AMD said on Wednesday that it will lay off 4% of its global staff as the longtime computer chipmaker seeks to gain a stronger foothold in the growing artificial intelligence chip space dominated by Nvidia.

*″*As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps that will unfortunately result in reducing our global workforce by approximately 4%,” an AMD representative said in a statement. “We are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.”

AMD had 26,000 employees at the end of last year, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

AMD is the second-biggest producer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, behind Nvidia. The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

AMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers, including the MI300X, which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

AMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD’s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024.

GPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD’s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

AMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel. Its share of server CPU sales rose nearly 3% on an annual basis in the third quarter to 34%, according to Mercury Research.

PG&E to deploy nuclear-specific AI at Diablo Canyon plant ,1gqokli,_hiddenscout,2024-11-14 03:18:24,18,0.85,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqokli/pge_to_deploy_nuclearspecific_ai_at_diablo_canyon/,"Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is deploying Atomic Canyon’s artificial intelligence-powered solutions for the nuclear energy sector at PG&E’s Diablo Canyon Power Plant, marking the inaugural commercial installation of the first on-site generative AI deployment at a U.S. generating facility.

Atomic Canyon’s Neutron Enterprise generative AI solution, built and running on NVIDIA’s full-stack AI platform, is being deployed at Diablo Canyon for document search and retrieval processes. PG&E also says the AI technology will deliver cost savings and improved operational efficiency.

Federal and state regulations require utilities that operate nuclear power plants to manage “billions of pages” of technical documentation, PG&E said, which are spread across multiple systems. Power plant personnel must spend both time and resources to retrieve this essential data – something PG&E argues the AI will help avoid. Neutron Enterprise is meant to integrate with Diablo Canyon’s systems, using the latest optical character recognition (OCR), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and AI-powered search technology meant to cut search times from hours to seconds.

“As the first nuclear power plant to implement Neutron Enterprise using the NVIDIA platform, we’re proud to lead the way in bringing cutting-edge innovation to our operations,” said Maureen Zawalick, vice president of business and technical services at Diablo Canyon Power Plant. “Atomic Canyon’s AI solutions will enable faster data retrieval, boosting collaboration and ensuring continued safe, but more efficient operations. Accessing critical information in seconds will let us focus on what truly matters—delivering reliable clean energy safely and affordably.”

The Neutron Enterprise solution is powered by Atomic Canyon’s FERMI family of AI models, developed in collaboration with the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and specifically designed for the nuclear energy sector.

As California’s only remaining nuclear power plant, Diablo Canyon provides nearly 9% of the state’s electricity and generates 17% of its zero-carbon energy. The California Energy Commission estimates that power demand across the state will rise roughly 43% in the next 15 years, which PG&E argues will make Diablo Canyon a more critical clean energy asset.

"NICE Ltd., an undervalued AI stock that is positioned well whether or not generative AI even works",1gqi2n6,Relevations,2024-11-13 22:48:21,0,0.49,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqi2n6/nice_ltd_an_undervalued_ai_stock_that_is/,"There may be literally only one stock that has not been swept up by AI hysteria, despite pivoting their business model to adapt to the prospect of generative AI - NICE Ltd.

NICE Ltd., headquartered in Ra'anana, Israel, provides advanced cloud-based software for customer experience (CX) and financial crime prevention. NICE specializes in AI-driven platforms like CXone, which supports customer engagement through AI-based customer routing, automated interactions, and real-time analytics. Their Enlighten AI suite enhances contact center operations by helping agents offer more responsive, personalized service. They also offer solutions for digital evidence management and fraud detection, serving sectors like public safety, law enforcement, and financial compliance.

NICE has been quietly rising ahead of their **earnings call tomorrow**, currently trading around $200. However, it is still WELL off of their high of $250. Their stock price the last several months has seen a sharp decline due to their longtime CEO, Barak Eilam, announcing his departure that will take place at the end of 2024. NICE, in my opinion, has taken an unfair beating for this news. Their replacement, Scott Russell, is an interesting hire due to his experience in the APAC market at a company the size of SAP and his international experience.

NICE has not penetrated the European and APAC market well at all, and this could be an incredible opportunity to grow revenue in those markets with his appointment. They are already well entrenched in some of the largest F500 companies in the Americas. It's about time they start looking abroad.

To speak on the tech itself, and whether or not generative AI will work in this industry, that itself represents an interesting scenario for NICE. In my opinion, whether or not AI works, NICE is positioned well. Their last earnings call, analysts asked Barak specifically about whether or not their generative AI systems are being used by their customers. He mentioned their proprietary ""co-pilot"", internally-faced AI used by customer service agents is being heavily utilized, and bookings is up 100% YOY for the technology, but that there is definitely still some hesitancy to roll out a generative AI customer service platform to the end consumer. This is fine, in my opinion, because if conceptually it doesn't work, NICE's technology is needed, and will serve the market as it has for years. If generative AI is the solution this industry will need, then they are even better positioned for that against the market with their technology. 

Some of the risks that I've heard. One is valid the other isn't. It is an Israeli based company, so there are going to be risks endemic there that are inevitable, which is valid.

I also hear about how large companies like Microsoft and Amazon will enter this market and take away market share. This is really unlikely. Microsoft, for example, tried to do a CRM tool and it is truly dogshit and has close to zero market share. And CX software requires much more domain expertise than doing a CRM tool, which they failed spectacularly at. 

I'll spare you the valuation work but...Anyway, stock is fairly priced close to $300, and is currently trading at $200. I got in at $165 earlier this year, but this is still a great opportunity.

Liberty Media to spin off assets; CEO Greg Maffei to step down at year-end,1gqe3uf,joethemaker22,2024-11-13 19:58:42,10,0.72,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqe3uf/liberty_media_to_spin_off_assets_ceo_greg_maffei/,">Liberty Media announced Wednesday it’s spinning off most assets besides Formula One auto racing into a separate publicly traded company, called Liberty Live, and that CEO Greg Maffei is stepping down at year-end. Chairman John Malone will become interim CEO of Liberty Media. Liberty Media’s investor day is set to take place on Thursday in Manhattan. After the split, Liberty Media will hold Formula One, which Liberty acquired in 2016 and later spun out as a tracking stock, and MotoGP, upon the closing of that transaction. Liberty Live will hold roughly 69.9 million shares of Live Nation Entertainment, sports experiences provider Quint and certain other assets, according to a release.

>The company also announced cable company Charter Communications  would acquire Liberty Broadband in an all-stock transaction. In September, Liberty Broadband went public with its aspirations to merge with Charter, in a move to simplify Malone’s portfolio. Liberty owns 26% of Charter shares. The Liberty Media and Liberty Live split is expected to be completed in the second half of 2025, and the sale of Liberty Broadband to Charter is expected to be completed in mid-2027. “The split-off of Liberty Live Group into a separate public entity will simplify Liberty Media’s capital structure, should reduce the discount to net asset value of our Liberty Live stock and enhance trading liquidity at both entities,” Maffei said in a release.

>Following today’s announcements at Liberty Media and Liberty Broadband, all the Liberty acquisitions completed during my tenure are now in structures where shareholders can have more direct ownership in their upside,” Maffei said in a separate release. “While it’s never easy to leave an organization as dynamic as Liberty, I am confident that this is the right time.” Maffei has been part of Liberty since 2005 and has various positions on boards of the company’s assets, including Charter. Malone is a pioneer of the cable industry, long known as the “cable cowboy,” and has kept his hand in various media assets over the years. He’s been an independent director of Warner Bros. Discovery — initially through Discovery, before the company merged with Warner Bros., under his advisement.

* The probability of a 25 bp cut on Dec. 18th has jumped to 82.3% as of 9:32 AM this morning.
* The economy will benefit as the interest rates come down.  The Fed has already cut 75bp this year fueling economy expansion with cheaper lending and increasing investments by corporations.
* Looser regulations and the expected tax cut for corporations with the upcoming administration will further propel the economy.  This will ameliorate the recent disappointing employment data.

Supermicro - hold or sell - my strategy,1gqa9ht,pais_tropical,2024-11-13 16:23:33,40,0.73,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqa9ht/supermicro_hold_or_sell_my_strategy/,"Disclosure of related position: I bought Supermicro for my growth and momentum trading strategy back in January 2022 for $43.20 (split aligned $4.32) and then doubled down the 6th of September 2022 for $64.22 (split aligned $6.422). Then I partially sold 15th May 2023 at 137.19 (split aligned 13.719), 10th of January 2024 at  $355 (split aligned $35.5) and 12th of September 2024 at $442.13 (split aligned $44.231).

I took out already much more than I did put in, but still own a large position of SMCI. Now I'm in the process of changing the rule for a complete selling in my strategy. As you can see in my disclosure I left a lot of money on the table which already made me change the way I take partial gains.

But let's speak about Supermicro here. What happened:

Hindenburg took a short position and published a report about bookkeeping fraud at Supermicro. Then the auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The company is now behind on the mandatory reports to the SEC two quarters. This weekend is the deadline for a de-listing on the NASDAQ. The stock tanked 82% from the high. According to the actual published numbers (which may be corrected) the stock is now almost as cheap as when I bought it first, even if the value more than quadrupled still after the loss of 82%.

Now, Hindenburg at first only cited ex employees as source. But the resignation of Ernst & Young as auditor was probably an ace in Hindenburgs sleeve. I personally know Ernst & Young, they are not exactly my favorites. Since they published the report there was a mass of bad news published, the exact same analysts that hived Supermicro to the SP500 more or less exactly at the high say now it is junk after that loss.

I was thinking about Apple. In the time it would have been most profitable to buy everybody shouted sell. The stock lost more than once 80% of its market value.

Supermicro owns a lot of very unique patents. Their liquid cooled systems take less time to build and are more modular than any of the other competitors systems, Dell being its main competitor. Even if they reported some orders too early as sale they sell a lot lot more than a few years ago thanks to AI. And they will probably sell a lot more.

I think it is very possible that we cannot trade Supermicro on the Nasdaq next week. An that means it will fall out of the SP500 and the NASDAQ 100, putting a lot of sell pressure on the ETF that mirror those indices. Or, Supermicro presents a new auditor and a plan to deliver the reports to the SEC by this weekend.

It is probably a binary bet that will be resolved soon. In my opinion the upside (probability to win multiplied with amount to win) is much higher than the downside (probability to lose multiplied with amount to lose). And even if it is delisted, it is far away from being worthless. Probably it will be a target for Dell.

All in all with the rise and fall of recession fears and the hovering election reactions - to cover the catalysts as of previous:

Federal rate cuts and lessening borrowing fees, growing average senior age, dwindling rates of new construction resulting in higher occupancy rates, and greater focus on specialized senior healthcare. 

For American Healthcare REIT - Currently the peak was +44% from initial post - with earnings from today beating wall street analyst EPS by 12.5% and beating YoY growth in 3/4 asset incomes. With debt, asset evaluations and growth rate as a rough value estimate, I believe it’s nearing the $30 fair value since it’s IPO earlier this year after they have purchased the final 24% minority stake of Trilogy Healthcare which has generated the majority of revenue from the company. They’ve done a stand up job making focuses on specialized care for senior homes and removing the outpatient medical properties, selling them off as they’ve been underperforming as of recent. I expect more reports of increased occupancy rates nearing 90% which would be pre-Covid levels. 

For the healthcare REIT sector - over the past year with recovery from COVID effects - the healthcare REIT stock sector has outperformed the US market by 22.7%, and the real estate sector in general by 65.8%. With the constantly increased forward guidance every quarter for AHR  and associated senior living REITs and the narrowing rate of new constructions that aren’t set to appear in bulk in the industry at least for a year or so - I expect the atmosphere to be relatively competitive.

The sector i believe will stay strong in the long run but especially right now during times of expensive new constructions costs, while dwindling interest rates (for now) will most likely give way to these companies projecting new asset properties to expand their revenue streams, the landscape is tight while the populace of seniors continues to grow by the day.

(Reuters) -Volkswagen Group raised its investment in Rivian by 16% to $5.8 billion and the two companies said on Tuesday they were launching their previously announced joint venture to develop electric vehicle architecture and software.

The companies said in June that VW would invest $5 billion in Rivian. Shares in the U.S. EV maker rose nearly 4% in extended trading.

The joint venture aims to integrate advanced electrical infrastructure and Rivian's software technology for future EVs of both companies, across all relevant vehicle segments, including subcompact cars, the firms said.

Volkswagen plans to invest the $5.8 billion in Rivian and the joint venture by 2027, including an initial $1 billion convertible note.

The Audi-parent will also invest $1.3 billion for intellectual property licenses and an equity stake and up to $3.5 billion in future equity, notes and debt, all tied to specific milestones.

Rivian's Chief Software Officer Wassym Bensaid and VW Group's Chief Technical Engineer Carsten Helbing will lead the joint venture named Rivian and VW Group Technology LLC.

Developers and engineers in the JV will be based initially in Palo Alto, California with three additional sites under development.

The joint venture will use Rivian's existing tech to launch Rivian's R2 in the first half of 2026 and potentially debut Volkswagen Group models as early as 2027.",2024-11-13,0.6124,Positive,"['VW', 'EV', 'VW', 'VW', 'LLC', 'JV']"

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: “In the third quarter 2024 we once again executed against our end-to-end space strategy with successes and key achievements reached across small and medium launch, as well as space systems. Revenue grew 55% year-on-year to $105 million and we continue to see strong demand growth with our backlog at $1.05 billion. Significant achievements for the quarter included signing a launch service agreement for multiple launches on Neutron with a confidential commercial satellite constellation customer; successfully launching twelve Electron launches year-to-date, making 2024 a record year for launches with more still to come; signing $55 million in new Electron launches, further cementing Electron’s position as a global launch leader; and being selected by NASA to complete a study contract for a proposal to retrieve samples from Mars and return them to Earth as part of a world-first mission. We expect to close out the year strongly with more Electron launches scheduled in November and December, alongside continued progress across Neutron and space systems, that is behind our guidance for a record $125-$135 million revenue quarter in Q4.”

2. If not, then how can I find them? What ways should I use?
3. If yes, then are these 2 test enough? And is there any platform which can help me perform these tests like just creating an excel sheet and uploading it into a tool and getting the results as this will be really helpful.

Who profits most from car industry?,1gpswb0,PlatHobbits7,2024-11-13 00:49:38,36,0.82,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gpswb0/who_profits_most_from_car_industry/,"As title suggest,

I'm wondering which segment within the car industry brings in the most profit?

I recently revisited the sector since my GPI holding is already over 200%. My thesis back then was the diversification between new/used/maintenance & international as it was something I felt important to be exposed to. However I am left uneducated on the overall industry.

I see car dealership stocks climbing higher and higher despite headlines of slowing sales or negative growth.

"Deep dive into eBay - The Rise, The decline and The Reality Check",1gpqebe,k_ristovski,2024-11-12 23:08:12,23,0.84,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gpqebe/deep_dive_into_ebay_the_rise_the_decline_and_the/,"**1.0 Introduction**

eBay was originally called “AuctionWeb” when it launched in 1995. Its founder, Pierre Omidyar, created it as part of his website to experiment with online auctions. He listed his broken laser pointer for sale and sold it for **$14.83**. When he asked if the buyer understood the laser pointer was broken, the buyer responded that he was a collector and was still interested.

In 1997 the name was changed to eBay, and the rest is history.

The most expensive item ever sold on eBay is the **Gigayacht**, a 405-foot luxury yacht designed by Frank Mulder. It was purchased for **$168 million** by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.

The auctions for a lunch with Warren Buffett also took place on eBay, with the 2022 auction being won by a bid of $19 million.



**2.0 Competition**

eBay has been primarily known as the auction go-to-place, as well as the place to go for 2nd hand items. Although there is an overlap with its competitors, there is no doubt that it dominates the 2nd hand market, especially for trading cards and collectibles and it can be labeled as the market leader in Recommerce and auctions.

Its competition comes in different forms:

* **Amazon & Walmart Marketplace** \- Global eCommerce platforms focused on new products sold by businesses and third-party sellers.
* **Facebook Marketplace & Craigslist** \- Local Recommerce platforms enabling individuals to buy/sell used items within their communities.
* **Etsy** \- Global eCommerce with a focus on handmade and unique products, though it includes some Recommerce elements for vintage goods.

eBay supports eCommerce, but that is a more crowded market, where Amazon is king.

  
**3.0 Its business model**

eBay’s revenue comes in many forms:

* Final value fees
* Listing fees
* Feature fees
* Store subscription fees
* Sale of advertisements
* Revenue sharing arrangements
* Shipping fees, etc.

Ultimately, they can be grouped into 2 buckets: Transaction revenue (\~85%) and advertising (\~15%).



**3.1 The key metrics that do not add up**

In companies of this kind, two important metrics are:

* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website.
* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMV.

Let’s have a look at both of them.

The GMV increased from $73b in 2019 (prior to the pandemic) to $87b during the pandemic and is not back to $74b. However, if you follow their take-rate, it went up from 9% to 14% between 2019 and LTM. But this is slightly misleading. eBay changed the definition of their ""take-rate"" in 2022.

It used to be calculated as **net transaction revenue** divided by **GMV** and it changed to **net revenue** divided by **GMV**.

So, I opted for an alternative take-rate, which is definitely not a generally accepted definition. That is: **operating profit** divided by GMV. The outcome is the % of the GMV that is kept by eBay after covering all the operating expenses. There, the increase is minimal, and this adjusted take rate fluctuates around 3%.



**4.0 Historical Financial Performance**

Although its revenue is flat (\~$10 billion), eBay is a cash-generating machine, bringing **\~$2 billion** in free cash flow per year *(\~1.4 billion if SBC is subtracted)*. 

Behind the scenes, there’s something else worth noting. Not only has the revenue not been growing, but the composition has changed.



|Revenue by geography (in $m)|2021|LTM|Change (in %)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|U.S.|$5.048|$5.185|3%|
|U.K.|$1.913|$1.588|\-17%|
|China|$856|$1.124|31%|
|Germany|$1.249|$967|\-23%|
|Rest of the world|$1.354|$1.402|4%|
|Total|$10.420|$10.266|\-1%|

UK and Germany are contributing significantly less, and this decline is being compensated by growth primarily coming from China. Given that China comes with its additional risks (and competition), it can be argued that the revenue today is of lower quality than the revenue back in 2021.

This could indicate that the penetration rate in the U.S. and Western Europe is at its peak and the average long-term growth that can be expected is around the 3% historical inflation rate.



**5.0 Capital allocation**

A huge focus of the management has been returning cash to the shareholders.

Since 2019, the company returned almost $28 billion ($25b via buybacks and $3b via dividends). A lot of this came from the company’s free cash flow, but part of it came from divestitures:

* Sold 80% of eBay Korea to eMart.
* Reduced ownership in Aurelia (the privatized Adevinta entity).

  
This led to a reduction of the number of shares outstanding by 40%. This is also a very impressive number if it is presented in isolation. However, half of the repurchases were done in 2020 and 2021, when the share price was quite elevated. In hindsight, that might not have been the best decision.

One notable long-term investment of theirs is Adyen, where they own 404k shares due to the warrants based on processing volume criteria. Given Adyen’s share price, these are worth around half a billion dollars.

  
**6.0 Valuation**

This is the time to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.

The key question to answer is - **Given what is known today, how much is the company worth?**

Based on everything mentioned above, my best estimate for revenue growth is in line with inflation, as this is a mature market with a high penetration rate in the developed countries.

Similarly, I do not see any levers that the company can pull to significantly increase its profitability. For that reason, I keep its operating margin at 21%.

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is $20.7b (**$43/share**), significantly below today’s share price of $62.

Here’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue growth & the operating margin:



|Revenue / Operating margin|19%|21%|23%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0% ($10.3b)|$29|$31|$33|
|34% ($13.8b)|$40|$43|$47|
|65% ($17.0b)|$47|$50|$54|



If the DCF model is reversed, for eBay to be fairly valued today, it needs to **double in size over the next decade** (average annual revenue growth of 7%) and **increase its operating margin to 23%.** Although this isn’t impossible, there’s no evidence that eBay’s growth will re-accelerate.

If you've listened/read anything from the most successful investors, all the red flags they bring up are being seen now.   When EVERYONE is so optimistic is now whats making me most nervous.  If you read about major crashes and recessions of the past, they are always precipitated with quotes from investors about how if you're not in the market you're losing out and everythings looking great, future is great,

Tariffs will be inflationary.  Tax cuts will disproportionately favor big businesses.  Interest rates are going down because the fed is reactionary. All of these have the recipe for inflation to increase again but this time squeezing americans to the point where buying stops.  It will also induce a panic in the market that might trigger a large correction.   Trump wants to increase local production which will help in the short-run, but his foreign policy is unpredictable so hard to say what oil imports will do.

I think most people have some cautious optimism, but at what point does it become more caution than optimism?

Netflix ad-supported tier has 70 million monthly users two years after launch,1gpodss,Puginator,2024-11-12 21:45:39,199,0.91,75,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gpodss/netflix_adsupported_tier_has_70_million_monthly/,"Netflix’s cheaper, ad-supported tier has reached 70 million global monthly active users two years after it was launched.

The company said Tuesday that more than 50% of its new sign-ups are for ad-supported plans in countries that offer the option. Netflix said it continues “to see positive momentum and growth across all areas of the business,” adding it has seen “steady progress across all countries’ member bases.”

Netflix launched the option in November 2022 as one of its responses to a slowdown in subscriber growth.

Recently, subscriber growth hasn’t been an issue. Last month Netflix reported it added 5.1 million subscribers during the third quarter, beating Wall Street estimates. In total, Netflix counts 282.7 million memberships across all of its pricing tiers.

Beginning next year, Netflix said it will no longer update investors on its subscriber numbers as it shifts focus toward revenue and other financial metrics as performance indicators.

When Netflix launched its ad platform two years ago, the company said Nielsen would rate its content.

Netflix in May announced it would air two National Football League games on Christmas Day this year as part of a three-year deal. On Tuesday it said it sold out of its ad inventory for the two live games.

Netflix also said it’s brought on FanDuel and Verizon as advertisers for the games. FanDuel will become the exclusive pregame sportsbook betting partner, Netflix said, and will have a sponsored in-show feature.

Media companies have been focusing on ad-supported strategies for their streaming options that woo customers with cheaper plans and also offer advertising revenue that can help move the streaming businesses toward profitability. While the ad market has been slow for traditional TV, it has grown for streaming and digital businesses.

Netflix offered its last update on its ad-supported tier in May, when it said it reached 40 million global monthly active users, nearly doubling the figure it had shared in January. That announcement came during Upfronts, when media companies make their pitches to advertisers.

Netflix also announced in May it would launch its own advertising platform, ending a partnership with Microsoft for that technology. It’s rolled out the platform in Canada and plans to launch it in the U.S. by the end of the second quarter next year. It plans to set the platform live everywhere by the end of 2025.

Starting Tuesday, anyone in LA will be able to use the Waymo One app to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County, the company said. That includes the 300,000 Angelenos who have been on Waymo’s waitlist.

With more than 3.8 million people, LA marks the third and largest city where the company’s robotaxi service is now fully available. It follows San Francisco, where Waymo One opened citywide in June. The company opened the service in Phoenix in 2020.

“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,” Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a news release Tuesday. “Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”

The company has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week across its three markets via the Waymo One app, the company said Tuesday. That’s up from 100,000 in August.

Waymo in September announced that it partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in 2025. The next-generation robotaxi from Waymo is a Geely Zeekr that’s equipped with custom sensors and an AI “driver.” Waymo also recently agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership with Hyundai that will add the South Korean automaker’s Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.

The Waymo One service has been embraced by some women who have safety concerns about riding with unknown human drivers. It has also been used by parents to send their teens to school.

Gamma Squeeze can make the stock price surge quickly in a short period of time, but this kind of increase is often unsustainable, because options market makers to buy a large number of shares, due to the stock price in a very high position, holding the risk is quite large, the options market makers will be the IV of the call options continue to raise, so that the operation of buying the call options become less lucrative

At this time, once someone sells a call option, the options market maker will sell shares to hedge, the stock price in a short period of time, the biggest buying momentum will disappear, the compression effect is lost, the stock price will turn down, a large number of profitable call options will also be closed, which in turn will lead to options market maker to sell more positive shares

For the next half month, we may try to move up and down first this week, but then I think TSLA is about to have a pullback close to 15%~20% or so.

1: In the Board of Directors meeting on November 12, 2024, there is an approved capital expenditure of around US$15.48 billion to support fab construction, technology capacity expansion, 2025 R&D, and sustaining capital expenditures. This means innovation and more profit.

  
2: Approved issuance of unsecured corporate bonds in Taiwan’s domestic market, up to NT$60 billion, for capacity expansion and pollution prevention efforts.

3: Approved the Business Report and Financial Statements for Q3 2024, reporting NT$759.69 billion in revenue and NT$325.26 billion in net income. The diluted earnings per share were NT$12.54.

4: In the Q3 report from TSMC: The projection for Q4 goes as followed:

**Revenue Projection**: US$26.1–$26.9 billion

* **Gross Profit Margin**: Expected between 57.0% and 59.0%
* **Operating Profit Margin**: Expected between 46.5% and 48.5%

Compare this to Q3:

* **Q3 2024 Actual Revenue**: **US$23.50 billion**
* **Q4 2024 Outlook Revenue**: **Between US$26.1 billion and US$26.9 billion**

  
**Q3 2024 Actual Profit Margin**: **57.8%**

* **Q4 2024 Outlook Profit Margin**: **Between 57.0% and 59.0%**

It’s too risky for my blood but wanted to get others thoughts and opinions about this ridiculously high yield dividend on a struggling company ",2024-11-12,-0.8006,Negative,['WBA']

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Chipotle Mexican Grill names Scott Boatwright as permanent CEO,1gp1s58,Puginator,2024-11-12 01:39:52,31,0.77,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gp1s58/chipotle_mexican_grill_names_scott_boatwright_as/,"Chipotle Mexican Grill on Monday named interim boss Scott Boatwright as permanent CEO of the burrito chain in a widely expected move, months after Brian Niccol exited the role to take the top job at Starbucks.

Boatwright, who has been at Chipotle since 2017, takes the helm as restaurants across the United States battle weak consumer demand in the face of higher menu prices.

In a surprise announcement in August, Starbucks named Niccol as its new CEO, leaving Chipotle under Boatwright, who has vowed to push the burrito chain to be a “global lifestyle brand” and expand to 7,000 restaurants in North America.

A veteran in the restaurant industry, Boatwright spent 18 years with Arby’s Restaurant Group before joining Chipotle in 2017.

He was named CEO following “a thorough and rigorous external search process,” Chipotle said in a statement on Monday.

Boatwright worked closely with Niccol to also steer the company out of a crisis following a severe E. coli and salmonella outbreak in 2015.

“Boatwright was by far the most logical choice given his instrumental role in leading Chipotle’s efforts to improve operations, integrate new technology, reduce employee turnover, and bolster customer satisfaction,” said Sharon Zackfia, analyst at William Blair.

His appointment as CEO comes amid a slew of changes to the top brass at Chipotle following Niccol’s exit. 

In August, Chipotle also accelerated the appointment of Adam Rymer as its chief financial officer, and named Rymer’s predecessor Jack Hartung as chief strategy officer.

Hartung was originally set to retire in March next year after a little over two decades as the company’s CFO. Rymer has been at Chipotle for 15 years, last serving as vice president of finance. 

“Boatwright as CEO should build confidence among investors in Chipotle’s management,” said Jim Sanderson, analyst at Northcoast Research. 

Chipotle’s stock lost $6 billion in market value immediately after Niccol’s departure. Since then, shares have risen about 14%.

Long time lurker here (26M) who is looking for some general advice.

I do quarterly rebalancing for my personal portfolio, though I offset it slightly (mid-Feb, May, Aug, and Nov rather than the standard end-of-quarter timing). This past quarter was a strong one—I realized significant gains thanks to the market’s recent surge (up 98% YTD), which leaves me in a unique position as I plan my next moves.

Right now, I’m facing a bit of a dilemma. The market feels extremely saturated, yet I also hesitate to sit on the sidelines or try to time a correction. I want to be thoughtful about redeploying my gains, but I’m not seeing many places to confidently put new money to work.

How are others in the community building conviction in their holdings? It feels like I keep hearing two extremes: either people are incredibly bullish, riding the wave, or they’re wary of a correction—yet staying fully invested in names like Costco, which is trading at a 56 P/E.

With Trump hinting at tariffs and pushing that ""America First"" vibe, the U.S. tech giants might finally have the leverage to say ""no thanks"" to a lot of the stuff Europe’s trying to force on them. The DMA is supposed to keep things competitive, but for companies like Apple, it’s just restrictive and honestly impacts their ability to innovate. If the U.S. government throws its weight behind them, these companies could really start pulling back from Europe’s grip and go about their business without being bogged down by EU red tape.



Europe’s supposed to be an innovation hub, but it’s really starting to look like the opposite. For startups, the endless admin, complex regulations, and sky-high taxes make it pretty much impossible to thrive. You have great ideas coming out of Europe, but the bureaucracy and costs just suffocate them before they can take off. Compare that to the U.S., where taxes are lower and there’s way less red tape, and you can see why so many are ditching Europe altogether. It’s like the EU’s digging its own grave when it comes to tech innovation, and the U.S. might be there to pick up the pieces.

 Market views:

1, the short side:

(1) The U.S. and Canadian markets are very close to saturation, ELF is certain categories have been ranked one or two, like the previous substantial growth is unlikely;

(2) The international market is a vast space for development, but it is estimated that the U.S. market can not be achieved as high-speed expansion;

(3) industry EV / EBITDA valuation, for those with growth, generally at 25 times, ELF in 22, 23 years, respectively, 37, 46;
2, multiple parties:

(1) international market has great potential, by FY27, revenues will reach 1.8 billion (now 1 billion), should be given a valuation of 71 times the P/E ratio, the target share price is $250

 Summary:

ELF was founded in 05, fast fashion beauty brand, with the success of the new media marketing in the past few years, the brand influence has increased greatly, after 21 years, the average 50% increase in revenues, the market capitalization is also soaring, soaring from $500 million to $12 billion, back to $7.3 billion now.

The biggest problem with fast fashion brands is that they tend to rise fast and fall fast; to form a brand moat, they still need more than a decade of precipitation.

So the observation of ELF is mainly to see whether its hotness in the United States can be sustained, as well as the development of overseas markets;

Overall, fast fashion beauty, because of its low technology and high profit, belongs to the products that need strong marketing, and it is considered a good idea to use new media + Netflix as the main marketing method.",2024-11-11,0.9992,Positive,"['ELF', 'US', 'US', 'CVS', 'ELF', 'OEM', 'ELF', 'UK', 'CEO', 'CEO', 'VP', 'IPO', 'ELF', 'EV', 'ELF', 'ELF', 'ELF']"

With $13 Options in the Money this past Friday and the Option Chain bullish at $15 by the end of this week, it is possible to see a spike in SoFi stock today given the combination of Shorts%, Low volume, Options in the Money, and the positive sentiment from the bullish Option Chain.

Plus the following:

* ALL of SoFi's Lending Business would get a strong tailwind as the interest rates fall and the biggest headwind within student loans would start to dissipate.
* As of June 2024, Americans owe about $1.6 trillion in student loans, 42% more than they owed a decade earlier.  SoFi has approximately 60% of the private student loan refinancing market.
* SoFi has reached 1 year of full profitability after Q3 2024.
* Institutional ownership is the highest it has ever been at 45.6% (Probably even higher when the new number comes out)
* SoFi wants to get loans from high-quality borrowers with high FICO scores. They were rejecting about 80% of the applicants.  They can easily raise that risk and jump their business as long as it stays within the default margin for profitability.   Their large increase in customers every quarter allows them to get low-cost funding for lending out money given their bank charter status, unlike many other Fintechs that don't have a bank charter.
* Looser regulation nourishes an environment for the rapidly growing SoFi. It is predicted that the new administration could change up to eight leaders at federal agencies overseeing the financial services industry.
* More leniency in approving IPOs that boost SoFi's IPO business.
* The upcoming tax cuts for big corporations will propel the uprising SoFi to grow much faster. The increased budget would allow outdated banks to invest in the newer/updated technology that SoFi's Cyberbank Core (Galileo & Technisys) has to offer to meet newer bank regulatory requirements.
* The new administration would likely abandon the proposed Basel III requirement. Basel III requires lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses. SoFi would have more liquidity and be able to invest more allowing it to make more money without this Basel III capital constraints.
* Short interest will go down at an accelerated rate as SoFi's stock price jumps.

Is there still runway for $TTWO?,1goqxi9,Interesting_Mix_3535,2024-11-11 17:51:55,7,0.59,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1goqxi9/is_there_still_runway_for_ttwo/,"For disclosure: I bought in TTWO at a cost basis around 140 last November after the official announcement by Rockstar about GTA 6. I am not looking to hold the stock long-term, but rather capitalise on the short-term wave brought about by GTA 6. My initial exit was 180, but the stock has reached this level almost entirely by the post-election rally, without much accounting for the catalyst I initially had in mind.

I am extremely bullish about the materiality of GTA 6's release on TTWO. Investors were likely anxious if GTA 6 was still able to draw the same hype as its predecessors did, but the official trailer on 6 Nov last year proved so. It broke the world record for highest number of first-day views for a non-music video, and is now the most-liked game trailer of all time. In response, share price increased by 20% over the next month as the market geared for more news. I continue to believe GTA 6 will be wildly popular with the general public - drawing milennials for nostalgia's sake and Gen Z (and onwards) who finally have a GTA title of their own generation.

For comparison, GTA 5 sold 11m copies and 800m in revenue within the first 24 hours. Analysts expect GTA 6 to eclipse 1B revenue in the first day, which already equals an entire quarter's worth of revenue. I believe these estimates are rather conservative, given how far the console/PC gaming market has advanced over the past decade. It is reasonable to expect GTA 6 to be a complete sell-out given all the reasons above. 

Last week, management finally gave us visibility of a GTA 6 release in Fall of 2025. This is already a bit of a delay given that management had previously hinted at a ""significant inflection point"" in 1Q25 which I had read as at least a pre-release. Therefore, there is a material risk that the company further delays the launch again; or worse, the product is a let-down.

I am wondering, if you think that the GTA 6 momentum has already been fully priced in on fundamentals, or if there is still further upside. ",2024-11-11,0.0772,Positive,"['TTWO', 'GTA', 'GTA', 'GTA', 'TTWO', 'GTA', 'GTA', 'GTA', 'GTA', 'GTA', 'PC', 'GTA', 'GTA', 'GTA']"

Is now the time to bet big on small caps IWM / XSMO or stick with VOO?

I started listening to Tom Lee last December, and for many things, I’m thankful.  However,  he’s been calling for small-cap rotation all year, and now he’s saying they will potentially “outperform by more than 100%” over the next couple of years because they’re trading at a discount relative to large caps. 

After some basic research earlier this year, I divided my investments between VOO (S&P 500), IWM (Russell 2000), XSMO (Momentum Small Cap), and IVOG (Mid Cap).  So far, VOO would have been better. 

I’m typically a long-term investor.  Would I be better off sticking with the tried-and-true VOO or continuing to diversify with small caps? And how does mid-cap IVOG fit into this mix?

Like all other defense stocks, SAAB gained a lot in the beginning of the Ukraine war and is now trading at around P/E 30 which is historically high and not that impressive.   
  
What makes the stock interesting now is how many orders have been coming in lately and how the price of the stock hasn't skyrocketed further in response, yet at least. Relative to other arms manufacturers, SAAB is not that large and their potential market cap is enormous.  
  
I initially bought a small position in SAAB because I was impressed with the fighter jet Gripen and figured that given the quite small current market cap it just takes 1-3 countries to adopt the Gripen system to massively increase the revenue for SAAB. Nowadays the orders just keep coming in, and the stock price is not really keeping up, so I've bought more shares. Colombia just decided to buy Gripen and Brazil is going to expand their fleet.

2: The IRA will unlikely to be fully repealed due to the massive amounts of employment it provides to red states.

3: While tariff will make clean energy projects more expensive on net, it also gradually reduces US clean energy firms' reliance on China which means a stronger future for the companies.

4: With regard to oil stocks, I believe the price of oil will drop significantly since drill baby drill which means Trump will expand oil drilling in the continental shells, so lower priced oil will reduce profit margins for oil companies, making oil stocks perform worst.

Reuters Exclusive: US ordered TSMC to halt shipments to China of chips used in AI applications,1gnos5a,Fidler_2K,2024-11-10 06:27:47,476,0.97,142,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gnos5a/reuters_exclusive_us_ordered_tsmc_to_halt/,"https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-ordered-tsmc-halt-shipments-china-chips-used-ai-applications-source-says-2024-11-10/

NEW YORK/SINGAPORE, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. ordered Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW), to halt shipments of advanced chips to Chinese customers that are often used in artificial intelligence applications starting Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Department of Commerce sent a letter to TSMC imposing export restrictions on certain sophisticated chips, of 7 nanometer or more advanced designs, destined for China that power AI accelerator and graphics processing units (GPU), the person said.

The U.S. order, which is being reported for the first time, comes just weeks after TSMC notified the Commerce Department that one of its chips had been found in a Huawei AI processor, as Reuters reported last month. Tech research firm Tech Insights had taken apart the product, revealing the TSMC chip and apparent violation of export controls.

Huawei, at the center of the U.S. action, is on a restricted trade list, which requires suppliers to obtain licenses to ship any goods or technology to the company. Any license that could aid Huawei's AI efforts would likely be denied.

TSMC suspended shipments to China-based chip designer Sophgo after its chip matched the one found on the Huawei AI processor, sources told Reuters last month.

Reuters could not determine how the chip ended up on Huawei's Ascend 910B, released in 2022, viewed as the most advanced AI chip available from a Chinese company.

The latest clampdown hits many more companies and will allow the U.S. to assess whether other companies are diverting chips to Huawei for its AI processor.

As a result of the letter, TSMC notified affected clients that it was suspending shipments of chips starting Monday, the person said.
The Commerce Department declined comment.

A spokesperson for TSMC also declined to comment beyond saying it was a ""law-abiding company...committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.""

The Commerce Department communication -- known as an ""is informed"" letter -- allows the U.S. to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to quickly impose new licensing requirements on specific companies.

Ijiwei, a Chinese media site covering the semiconductor industry, reported on Friday that TSMC notified Chinese chip design companies it would suspend 7 nanometer or below chips for AI and GPU customers beginning Nov. 11.

The action comes as both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the inadequacy of export controls on China and the Commerce Department's enforcement of them.

In 2022, the Commerce Department sent is-informed letters to Nvidia and AMD restricting their ability to export top AI-related chips to China, and to chip equipment makers like Lam Research, Applied Materials and KLA to restrict tools to make advanced chips to China.

The restrictions in those letters were later turned into rules that apply to companies beyond them.

The U.S. has been delayed in updating rules on tech exports to China. As Reuters reported in July, the Biden administration drafted new rules on some foreign exports of chipmaking equipment and planned to add about 120 Chinese companies to the Commerce Department's restricted entity list, including chipmaking factories, toolmakers, and related companies.

But despite plans for an August release, and later tentative target dates for publication, the rules still have not been issued.",2024-11-10,-0.4323,Negative,"['NEW', 'YORK', 'TW', 'TSMC', 'AI', 'GPU', 'TSMC', 'AI', 'TSMC', 'AI', 'TSMC', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'TSMC', 'TSMC', 'TSMC', 'AI', 'GPU', 'AMD', 'AI', 'KLA']"

I am looking at a company stock ticker CE. They are a chemicals company. The recent crash in share price is what prompted me to ""kick the tires"" on this name.

I am looking specifically at their balance sheet.

They have about 12B in long term debt. They made a big acquisition a few years back for about 10B. They essentially have 12B of bonds of which about 1B come due every year.

This year, they did not make enough money to pay off their bonds so they drew down 1B from their cash to pay off their bond. Now they only have 800m cash left. They anticipate that they cannot pay off their 2025 bonds and have already arranged short term financing to pay it off. Their debt coverage ratio is 1.4.

They are shutting down plants left and right to save money. They cut their dividend by 95%.

> Wendy's supply chain purchases are handled by an independent co-op group that first tested Palantir's technology last year amid tight profit margins and increasing pressure from inflation, according to a Bloomberg report. The group is using Palantir's system to spot shortages and suggest solutions like placing an order from a supplier. Pete Suerken, who leads the purchasing co-op, said the system's AI learns over time and can suggest a specific warehouse, after considering factors such as cost and the probability of the items arriving on time. The software can predict when specific products will run out by analyzing current and historical sales figures.

> Suerken praised Palantir's platform and said it was ""so much better"" than spreadsheets and other customary inventory management methods. He also said the return on investment is ""significant."" Wendy's recently asked the supply chain program to identify shortages restaurants could face over the following three weeks and then staff trained the model by showing how the shortages should be solved. Wendy's purchasing group plans to eventually allow the AI model to manage smaller inventory and ordering tasks autonomously and without human intervention.

(Made a mistake with the CSL because it hae a weighting of over 5% in VAS but I am not sure if its bad to sell it for another stock because Tax reasons? Can someone advise me if I should just leave it?

I constantly hear some people talk about just putting all or 99% into S&P500 and then I hear the opposite argument of needing to be diversified in not just US and AUS but also WW and also even at what percentages you should have in each Stock

Personally for this reason I did put some of my Stocks into AUS and WW (As per above) but because of the past think the returns on the S&P500 will be better hence why I have overweighted it (I know the past does not have to repeat iself) but my risk tolerance is somewhat high being married at 30 with no kids and wanting to make my first million ASAP but I am feeling like maybe I have far too high a weighting in the USA is my main question, and if I do with my remaining 50k is it worth sacrificing potential returns from S&P 500 to diversify more? i'd love opinions on this because current plan is just to go ham on the S&P500

Automakers will have to respond and they aren’t going to use Tesla or Waymo since those are competitive threats. The only viable solution will be MBLY.

MBLY already announced Volkswagen as their first main autonomous driving win. At their upcoming Dec 9th analyst day, we may get more announcements. A year from now, all of the big 10 automakers will have a plan for autonomous driving and most of them likely select MBLY.

Each customer like Volkswagen is \~$3b revenue a year (9m cars @ 25% attach rate @ $1500 ASP). MBLY’s current revenue is $2b. So by 2028, MBLY’s revenue could be $15b vs $2b today. Meanwhile the stock is on lows due to near-term noise around weak total auto units industry wide, etc, creating a great entry point.

$MBLY is my next 10 bagger. In 2027, the stock will be $170.",2024-11-09,0.9081,Positive,"['MBLY', 'MBLY', 'MBLY', 'MBLY', 'ASP', 'MBLY', 'MBLY', 'MBLY']"
Are the NANC and CRUZ tracking ETF’s a good investment you're implementing in your portfolio?,1gms4ft,portrayaloflife,2024-11-09 01:54:09,11,0.79,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gms4ft/are_the_nanc_and_cruz_tracking_etfs_a_good/,"With all the talk this election about congressional insider trading and looking at these various Saas and ETF options that follow US representative trades I was curious what y'all perspective was on these and if you're taking them seriously at all as a diversification play or if they are just kind of meme ETF's.

The NANC ETF aims to track the stock trades made by members of Congress and their spouses, focusing on trades involving Democratic members. As of September 30, 2024, NANC hit a one-year total return of about 40%, Whoa, which outpaces the S&P 500's gain of around 22% over the same period​.

On the other hand, the KRUZ ETF, which tracks trades by Republican members of Congress, has generally shown competitive returns but with less gains than NANC. 

Both ETFs seem to be a part of a broader trend in thematic investing that targets political market behavior which is interesting. Their management fees/expense ratio are both 0.75% which feels super high compared to like VOO (.03%).

These are both relatively new. And presumably could also be made obsolete if certain legislation passes that bans Congressional reps from investing while serving. 

Just wanted to get others take on these. Appreciate your time!

Lyft Achieves Record-Breaking Q3 2024 with Surge in Riders and Revenue,1gmrva1,Fountainheadusa,2024-11-09 01:43:04,28,0.82,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gmrva1/lyft_achieves_recordbreaking_q3_2024_with_surge/,"I added more Lyft, Inc. (LYFT) shares this morning at $17.50 following their excellent Q3-2024 results. I had first started buying Lyft last month at $13.50.

Lyft demonstrated remarkable growth in the third quarter of 2024, posting significant gains in both operational metrics and financial performance. The rideshare giant reported record-breaking numbers in active riders and total rides, while substantially improving its financial position through increased revenue and robust cash flow generation.

# STRENGTHS AND OPPORTUNITIES

**Excellent revenue, EBITDA and Cash Flow growth** 

* **Gross Bookings**: Reached $4.1 billion, marking a 16% year-over-year increase
* **Revenue**: Hit $1.5 billion, showing substantial growth of 32% year-over-year
* **Net Loss**: Posted $(12.4) million, including a $36.4 million restructuring charge
* **Adjusted EBITDA**: Achieved $107.3 million, up from $92.0 million in Q3'23
* **Free Cash Flow**: Generated $242.8 million, a significant improvement from $(30.0) million in Q3'23

**Solid Operational Achievements**

The company set new records in its core operational metrics:

* Reached 24.4 million Active Riders (9% YoY growth)
* Delivered 217 million Rides (16% YoY growth)
* Maintained strong driver engagement with record driver hours

**Strategic Initiatives In Autonomous Vehicles**

Lyft announced significant partnerships in the autonomous vehicle space, positioning itself for future growth:

* Formed alliances with Mobileye, May Mobility, and Nexar
* Plans to launch autonomous vehicle service in Atlanta by 2025

**Strategic Partnership with DoorDash**

* Established collaboration with DoorDash, the leading U.S. local delivery platform
* Introduced exclusive benefits for DashPass members using Lyft services

# WEAKNESSES AND CHALLENGES

* Secondary player to Uber (UBER) in the rideshare market, only 30% market share compared to Uber’s 70%.
* Doesn’t have the secondary revenue stream of Uber Eats to absorb fixed costs
* Smaller market share and geographic footprint
* Limited brand recognition internationally
* Heavy reliance on incentives to attract/retain drivers and riders
* High customer acquisition costs
* Competitive pressure on pricing

**Wall Street seems to like it as well**

“We think the strong after-hours move is deserved,” Sanderson adds, and think the results will ease concern about Lyft’s ability to grow profitably. “But management’s 15% multi-year \[gross bookings\] target will still be a debate, as will the company’s position for autonomous vehicles.”

“Efficiencies are driving EBITDA ahead of expectations, and the profitability of the rides business model shined, even through increased investment into rider/demand-based incentives,” Morgan Stanley’s Nowak added, raising his FY25/26 adjusted EBITDA estimates by 9% and 2%, respectively, contributing to a higher price target of $18 from $16, previously.

BofA Securities also lifted its price target, now at $19, as the company has “seemingly limited incremental share losses, focusing on core customers and commuters that are still growing order frequency.”

“We have a Buy rating on Lyft as tailwinds from mobility/transportation recovery in urban areas are outweighing risk factors like driver wage inflation, inflation’s impact on consumer travel, and competition risk from Uber and new autonomous entrants,” BofA’s Michael McGovern and Justin Post said in their research note.

**Continuing to accumulate for 3-5 years.**

Lyft has a long way to go, but the first and second quarter of adjusted operating profits in a row and strong cash flow generation suggest that it is a serious competitor to Uber.

I had recommended and started buying Lyft in October around $13-$14, calling it an attractive GARP (Growth At A Reasonable Price), and a very reasonable valuation compared to Uber, which is unlikely to have a monopoly in the ride-sharing market.

Lyft deserves a seat at the table and with excellent Q3 results and raised guidance it looks even more compelling. Sure, there was a massive bump from $14 to $17. post earnings but the valuation is still attractive at 1.1x sales for 12-15% sales growth and at 17x earnings for a 15-17% grower.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

* **Earnings per share:** 40 cents adjusted vs. 34 cents expected

The company said that fourth-quarter revenue will be between the range of $1.125 million to $1.145 million. The midpoint of the fourth-quarter guidance, $1.135 million, trailed analyst estimates of $1.143 million.

Sales in Pinterest’s third-quarter rose 18% from $763.2 million a year ago.

Pinterest said it had 537 million global monthly active users in the third quarter, topping analyst estimates of 532.6 million.  

The company’s net income grew a whopping 354% year over year to $30.56 million. Its total cost and expenses for the quarter were $904 million, up 17% compared with $768 million the previous year.

Pinterest’s latest quarterly earnings follows the recent U.S. presidential election earlier in the week in addition to multiple earnings reports from other tech companies with online advertising businesses.

Last week, Amazon said its ads business grew 19% year over year to $14.3 billion in the third quarter, and Meta said its third-quarter sales rose 19% year over year to $40.59 billion. However, Meta shares dropped slightly on weaker-than-expected user numbers and warned of a significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses in 2025.

Alphabet said during its third-quarter earnings last week that advertising sales in the period grew 10% year over year to $65.85 billion while its YouTube video unit reported ad revenue of $8.92 billion, up 12% from the previous year.

Microsoft said last week that its search and news advertising revenue jumped 18% year over year as part of its latest earnings report, but the company does not reveal that unit’s specific quarterly sales numbers.

Reddit and Snap also reported their most recent quarterly earnings last week. Reddit said that sales in its third quarter soared 68% to $348.4 million from the prior year while Snap’s third-quarter revenue grew 15% year over year to $1.37 billion.

Airbnb stock up 8% as revenue jumps,1gm1b2f,Puginator,2024-11-08 02:43:28,81,0.85,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gm1b2f/airbnb_stock_up_8_as_revenue_jumps/,"Airbnb reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday that were shy of analyst estimates, though it squeaked in a small revenue beat. The stock jumped about 8% in after-hours trading.

Here’s how the company did:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.13 vs. $2.14 expected by LSEG
* **Revenue:** $3.73 billion vs. $3.72 billion expected by LSEG

Revenue increased 10% from $3.4 billion a year earlier. Airbnb reported a net income of $1.37 billion, or $2.13 per share, compared to $4.37 billion, or $6.63 per share, in the same period last year.

The company expects to report revenue between $2.39 billion and $2.44 billion during its fourth quarter. Analysts were expecting $2.42 billion for the period, according to LSEG.

In its letter to shareholders, Airbnb said it is focused on expanding beyond its core markets and into under-penetrated markets around the globe. The average growth rate of nights booked in Airbnb’s expansion markets was double that of its core markets on an origin basis during the third quarter, the company said.

“We’ll remain focused on accelerating growth while preparing for Airbnb’s next chapter, which will take us beyond accommodations,” Airbnb said. “You’ll see more on this next year.”

Airbnb said adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $2 billion, up 7% year over year. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were expecting $1.86 billion.

Gross booking value, used by Airbnb to track host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $20.1 billion in the third quarter. That’s above the $19.9 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. The company reported 123 million nights and experiences booked, up 8% from a year ago, and higher than the 121.4 million expected by StreetAccount.

Airbnb said it saw hosting growth across all regions and market types during the third quarter. The company has more than 8 million active listings and has worked to improve listing quality, according to its shareholder letter. Airbnb has removed more than 300,000 listings since last year.

Average daily rates increased 1% from a year ago to $164 in the third quarter, the company said.

Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by a quarter point,1gly6hr,OG_Time_To_Kill,2024-11-08 00:32:19,1015,0.97,120,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gly6hr/federal_reserve_cuts_interest_rates_by_a_quarter/,"**Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by a quarter point**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/fed-rate-decision-november-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/fed-rate-decision-november-2024.html)

*The Federal Reserve approved its second consecutive interest rate cut Thursday, moving at a less aggressive pace than before but continuing its efforts to right-size monetary policy.*  
  
*In a follow-up to September’s big half percentage point reduction, the Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis points, to a target range of 4.50%-4.75%. The rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending but often influences consumer debt instruments such as mortgages, credit cards and auto loans.*  
  
*Markets had widely expected the move, which was telegraphed both at the September meeting and in follow-up remarks from policymakers since then. The vote was unanimous, unlike the previous move that saw the first “no” vote from a Fed governor since 2005. This time, Governor Michelle Bowman went along with the decision.*  
  
*The post-meeting statement reflected a few tweaks in how the Fed views the economy. Among them was an altered view in how it assesses the effort to bring down inflation while supporting the labor market.*  
*“The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance,” the document stated, a change from September when it noted “greater confidence” in the process.*  
*Fed officials have justified the easing mode for policy as they view supporting employment becoming at least as much a priority as arresting inflation.*  
*On the labor market, the statement said “conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low.” The committee again said the economy “has continued to expand at a solid pace.“*  
*Officials have largely framed the change in policy as an attempt to get the rate structure back in line with an economy where inflation is drifting back to the central bank’s 2% target while the labor market has shown some indications of softening. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has spoken of “recalibrating” policy back to where it no longer needs to be as restrictive as it was when the central bank focused almost solely on taming inflation.*  
*Powell will answer questions about the decision at his 2:30 news conference. The November meeting was moved back a day due to the presidential election.*  
*There is uncertainty over how far the Fed will need to go with cuts as the macro economy continues to post solid growth and inflation remains a stifling problem for U.S. households.*  
*Gross domestic product grew at a 2.8% pace in the third quarter, less than expected and slightly below the Q2 level but still above the historical trend for the U.S. around 1.8%-2%. Preliminary tracking for the fourth quarter is pointing to growth around 2.4%, according to the Atlanta Fed.*  
*Generally, the labor market has held up well. However, nonfarm payrolls increased by just by 12,000 in October, though the weakness was attributed in part to storms in the Southeast and labor strikes.*  
*The decision comes amid a changing political backdrop.*  
*President-elect Donald Trump scored a stunning victory in Tuesday’s election. Economists largely expect his policies to pose challenges for inflation, with his stated intentions of punitive tariffs and mass deportations for undocumented immigrants. In his first term, however, inflation held low while economic growth, outside of the initial phase of the Covid pandemic, held strong.*  
*Still, Trump was a fierce critic of Powell and his colleagues during his first stint in office, and the chair’s term expires in early 2026. Central bankers assiduously steer clear of commenting on political matters, but the Trump dynamic could be an overhang for the course of policy ahead.*  
*An acceleration in economic activity under Trump could persuade the Fed to cut rates less, depending on how inflation reacts.*  
*Questions have arisen over what the “terminal” point is for the Fed, or the point at which it will decide it has cut enough and has its benchmark rate where it is neither pushing nor holding back growth. Traders expect the Fed likely will approve another quarter-point cut in December then pause in January as it assesses the impact of its tightening moves, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.*  
*The FOMC indicated in September that members expected a half percentage point more in cuts by the of this year and then another full percentage point in 2025.*  
*The September “dot plot” of individual officials’ expectations pointed to a terminal rate of 2.9%, which would imply another half percentage point of cuts in 2026.*  
*Even with the Fed lowering rates, markets have not responded in kind.*  
*Treasury yields have jumped higher since the September cut, as have mortgage rates. The 30-year mortgage, for instance, has climbed about 0.7 percentage point to 6.8%, according to Freddie Mac. The 10-year Treasury yield is up almost as much.*  
*The Fed is seeking to achieve a “soft landing” for the economy in which it can bring down inflation without causing a recession. The Fed’s preferred inflation indicator most recently showed a 2.1% 12-month rate, though the so-called core, which excludes food and energy and is generally considered a better long-run indicator, was at 2.7%.*

*Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.*

*The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.*

*In support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.*

*In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.*

*Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Beth M. Hammack; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; and Christopher J. Waller.*",2024-11-08,0.8701,Positive,"['CME', 'FOMC', 'FOMC']"

Qualcomm pops on chipmaker's earnings and revenue beat,1glceac,Puginator,2024-11-07 04:57:53,90,0.92,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1glceac/qualcomm_pops_on_chipmakers_earnings_and_revenue/,"Qualcomm reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, and the company guided to a strong December quarter.

The shares rose 10% in extended trading at one point before falling to a gain of about 4%.

Here’s how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus expectations for the quarter ending Sept. 29:

Earnings per share: $2.69, adjusted $2.56 expected

Revenue: $10.24 billion versus $9.90 billion expected

Qualcomm said it expects revenue in the current quarter of between $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion, with the midpoint of that range beating LSEG consensus expectations of $10.59 billion.

The company reported $2.92 billion in net income, or $2.59 per share, a sharp jump from last year’s $1.49 billion, or $1.23 per share. Qualcomm reported $33.19 billion in total revenue in its fiscal 2024, a 9% increase from 2023.

Qualcomm’s fortunes have historically been tied to the smartphone industry, where the company provides a range of chips to handset makers, including system-on-a-chip processors, modems, and antennas. The company makes the chip at the heart of most high-end Android devices, and many lower-end phones as well. Qualcomm also sells modems and related chips to Apple for its iPhones, and last year said its contract for 5G chips ran through 2026.

Qualcomm reported a 12% increase in handset chip sales to $6.1 billion, in line with FactSet estimates. Qualcomm introduced its high-end chip for 2025, called Snapdragon 8 Elite, in October.

“In handsets we delivered greater than 20% year-over-year growth in Android revenues,” said Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala on a call with analysts.

Under CEO Cristiano Amon, the company has diversified away from being a smartphone supplier and has introduced and invested heavily in producing chips for PCs, cars, and industrial machines.

“We will continue to transform Qualcomm from a wireless communications company into a connected computing company for the age of AI,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said on the earnings call with analysts.

Qualcomm has also made efforts to brand itself as a leader in AI, having developed smartphone chips with specialized parts for machine learning since 2017. But unlike Nvidia, the company doesn’t produce the kind of graphics processors for data centers that are used for big AI programs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

The automotive business grew 86% on an annual basis to $899 million in sales. Qualcomm says it has billions of dollars in business with automakers currently in its development pipeline, and highlighted it was the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Qualcomm said that it expected automotive sales in the current quarter to rise 50% on an annual basis.

The company’s “internet of things” business includes both chips for industrial purposes as well as the chips Meta uses in its Quest handsets and Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. It also includes the new business selling chips for laptops running Microsoft Windows. The division reported $1.68 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from a year earlier.

Qualcomm’s chip business, including its handset, automotive, and other chips, which together is reported as QCT, saw sales rise 18% during the quarter to $7.37 billion in total. 

The company’s profitable technology licensing business, QTL, reported $1.52 billion in revenue, a 21% increase over the same period last year.

Qualcomm said its board had approved $15 billion in additional buybacks. During the fourth quarter, it repurchased $1.3 billion worth of shares and paid out $947 million in dividends.

E.l.f. shares soar as cosmetics retailer raises guidance after posting 40% sales gain,1gl9i2e,Puginator,2024-11-07 02:51:45,103,0.89,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gl9i2e/elf_shares_soar_as_cosmetics_retailer_raises/,"E.l.f. Beauty raised its full-year guidance on Wednesday after posting a 40% growth in sales. 

Shares of the company rose nearly 20% in after-hours trading.

The cosmetics retailer’s earnings came in well ahead of expectations on the top and bottom lines and it now expects sales to be between $1.32 billion and $1.34 billion during fiscal 2025, ahead of the $1.30 billion analysts had expected, according to LSEG. 

Here’s how E.l.f. did in its second fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 77 cents adjusted vs. 43 cents expected

Revenue: $301 million vs. $286 million expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Sept. 30 was $19 million, or 33 cents per share, compared with $33 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, E.l.f. saw earnings of $45 million, or 77 cents per share.  

Sales rose to $301 million, up about 40% from $216 million a year earlier. 

E.l.f. raised its full-year revenue guidance from a previous range of $1.28 billion to $1.3 billion and also raised its adjusted earnings guidance. The retailer is expecting adjusted earnings to be between $3.47 to $3.53 per share, up from a prior outlook of between $3.36 and $3.41 per share. Analysts had been looking for earnings guidance of $3.51, according to LSEG. 

The cosmetics company has been on a tear over the past couple of years thanks to its viral marketing and its prowess in winning over young shoppers with its value versions of prestige favorites. 

“We’re seeing multi-generational appeal on E.l.f. Not only are we the No. 1 brand amongst Gen Z by a pretty wide margin, but we’re also the most purchased brand amongst Gen Alpha and millennials,” CEO Tarang Amin said in an interview with CNBC. “We’re picking up consumers in pretty much every age and income cohort, which is great to see, and I think just talks to the strength of our strategy and the quality of our products.” 

Amin said that success has led both Target and Walgreens to plan to expand the shelf space they allot for the retailer starting in the spring. 

During the quarter, E.l.f.’s selling, general and administrative costs rose by $74 million to $186.1 million, or 62% of net sales, but it still managed to post a 71% gross margin, an increase of 0.4 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. 

Tang attributed the increase in margin to favorable foreign exchange rates, previously enacted price increases internationally and its overall value proposition. 

“Our ability to engineer prestige quality at these extraordinary prices has been the real driver, but most of our margin progress over the years has been through our innovation mix,” Amin said. “As we introduce a new one of our holy grails, it gives us the opportunity to inch up margin a little bit while still offering an incredible value.” 

The company has also been building out its international sales, which now make up about 21% of overall revenue. 

Amin said its exposure to markets outside of the U.S. will help soften the blow from any tariff hikes that could come under President-elect Donald Trump.

Post-January, we're likely to be entering a period of increased tensions with China. This seems bad for Nvidia in multiple ways.

1. Beijing has previously expressed desire to urgently switch away from NVDA chips and invest locally. Obviously that's easier said than done, but with China being such a huge market for NVDA, increased tensions over tariffs could push this mandate further.

"Toyota posts nearly 20% drop in second-quarter operating profit, missing estimates",1gkxptd,Puginator,2024-11-06 18:18:59,379,0.97,144,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gkxptd/toyota_posts_nearly_20_drop_in_secondquarter/,"Japanese automaker Toyota Motor on Wednesday reported its first quarterly operating profit drop in about two years, as it strives to navigate the market shift toward electric vehicles.

Here are Toyota’s results compared with estimates from analysts, compiled by LSEG.

Revenue: 11.44 trillion yen vs. 11.41 trillion yen

Operating profit: 1.16 trillion yen vs. 1.24 trillion yen

The world’s largest automaker by sales volume saw a 20% year-on-year drop in operating profit during the quarter.

Net profit attributable to company more than halved to 573.7 billion yen from 1.28 trillion a year ago.

The automaker’s sales volume for the second-quarter slipped to 2.3 million from 2.42 million units a year ago.

Still, Toyota raised its full-year dividend forecast to 90 yen, up from 75 yen a year earlier.

Toyota has been slower in embracing fully battery-powered electric vehicles, with chairman Akio Toyoda reportedly saying that an “electric-vehicle only future” would lead to job losses in the automotive industry.

“There are 5.5 million people involved in the automotive industry in Japan. Among them are those who have been doing engine-related (work) for a long time,” Toyoda told reporters, according to Reuters.

“If electric vehicles simply become the only choice, including for our suppliers, those people’s jobs would be lost.”

The company maintained a full-year operating profit of 4.3 trillion yen.

Toyota also has been in the spotlight this year due to the multiple vehicle recalls, most recently in September.

The latest recall of 42,000 vehicles was over the loss of power brake assist that can extend the distance required to stop, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It affected certain 2023-2024 Corolla Cross Hybrid vehicles, the administration said.

Early in June, Toyota lost over $15 billion in market value after Japan’s Transport Ministry found false data was used by Japanese automakers to certify certain models.

The wide-ranging inspection by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism also found irregularities in certification applications by other automakers Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha.

* More leniency in approving IPOs that boost SoFi's IPO business.
* The probable upcoming tax cuts for big corporations will propel the uprising SoFi to grow much faster. The increased budget would allow outdated banks to invest in the newer/updated technology that SoFi's Cyberbank Core (Galileo & Technisys) has to offer to meet newer bank regulatory requirements.
* The new administration would likely scale back or scrap the proposed Basel III requirement. Basel III requires lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses. SoFi would have more liquidity and be able to invest more allowing it to make more money without this Basel III capital constraints.

Vanguard has deposed its rival BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, from its position as manager of the second-largest exchange traded fund in the world.

In a rare setback for the fund giant, BlackRock’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) has been overtaken by Vanguard’s equivalent S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which had assets of $540.76bn at Friday’s close, according to data from Morningstar, marginally ahead of IVV’s $540.66bn.

“I expect VOO to catch SPY and become the largest ETF in the world in 2025, or 2026, at the latest,” Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar added. “VOO is set to smash the single-year inflows record, having already pulled in $85bn this year.

Super Micro Computer- SMCI $26 - Avoid Till We Get Restated Financials,1gkgqx3,Fountainheadusa,2024-11-06 02:11:01,102,0.93,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gkgqx3/super_micro_computer_smci_26_avoid_till_we_get/,"**I think Super Micro Computer, (SMCI) should be avoided for the following reasons:**

**Restatements could alter the financials significantly:** The odds are high that the company will end up restating past financials. The Auditor’s resignation, its CEO’s pay package, and its past settlement with the SEC in 2018 all suggest that SMCI will have to restate its financial statements.

**No 10K:** SMCI has delayed its annual 10-K filing and without an audited 10K, we have precious little faith in the numbers. 

**SMCI has priors:** This was not their first time. In 2018, the company settled charges with the [SEC for improper accounting](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-190). As stated in the article from the SEC website….

>

**Tainted:** To me the alleged malfeasance creates significant doubts for investors that will not go away for a while, and it's very likely that Wall Street will not touch it, fearing liability for not doing enough due diligence. Also, I can’t imagine SMCI getting a decent multiple in the future for the same reasons until faith is restored in management and its books.

**Possible Loan Default:**  There is a significant risk of Super Micro defaulting on the company's Term Loan Agreement with Bank of America. 

**Compensation tied to aggressive revenue targets**: The CEO’s unusual compensation package, with virtually no base salary and bonuses tied to very aggressive revenue and share price targets, is a dangerous and potentially abusive practice.

**Possible delisting from the Nasdaq, and getting thrown out of the S&P 500**: The chances of both are high as a new auditor needs to be found, and a substantial amount of restatement work needs to be done.

**A great business:** Sure, SMCI has a great server liquid cooling business, which has tremendous potential and demand for server racks for AI GPUs, right now and for the foreseeable future. However, as we saw Nvidia has already started shifting this business.

**Ignore the low valuation:** I’m going to ignore the current low valuation of 8x earnings and 0.5x sales, which are much lower than competitors such as Dell (DELL) and Oracle (ORCL), simply because I have no idea what the restated financials will look like, and the valuation could be a lot different

The only way I would invest is the possibility of a merger/acquisition/White Knight, that will keep the stock afloat. The CEO owns close to 10% of the company so I doubt if he would let this go without a fight.

The other problem I foresee is the difficulty of getting good and timely information. For the most part, we rely on analysts who expect a proper set of books. Instead of focusing on the fundamentals, we’ll be spending far too much time, and worse without success trying to figure out what is genuine or not, It would make better sense to invest in other GPU/semiconductor businesses.

Can anyone write play by play like how it may happen. I am going to try first below:

1. Say in 2025 inflation is still above 2.6% and economic activity points to strong labor market and GDP growth of 3% but still congress approves tax cuts for everyone at the cost of deficit. They also approve infrastructure projects costing trillions in deficit. But Fed continues to cut rates. Fed helps the govt fund it's deficit by buying treasury bonds if demand is low considering real yield is zero or negative.
2. Inflation goes much higher due to higher spending by businesses and consumers but Fed does not raise rates.
3. Say they tolerate inflation upto 5-6% while keeping short term rates at 3% or lower and forcing long term treasury rate below 4% because of fed buying them.

This will have the effect of debt being discounted every year by 2-3% just like how it has happened between 2020 to 2023.

I have seen developing countries like India tolerate inflation level of 10-12% every year resulting in their debt value getting reduced by 90% in 15-20 years, while their GDP keeps growing.

&#x200B;

*When Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long-promised, next-generation $25,000 electric vehicle, the automaker’s stock plunged. Chief Executive Elon Musk rushed to respond on X, his social-media network.*  
*“Reuters is lying,” he posted, without elaborating. Tesla’s stock recovered some of its losses.*  
*Six months later, Musk appears to have backed into an admission that Tesla dropped its plans for a human-driven $25,000 car. He said in an Oct. 23 earnings call that building the affordable EV would be ""pointless” unless the car was fully autonomous.*  
*His latest remarks came in response to an investor asking: “When can we expect Tesla to give us the $25,000 non-robotaxi regular car model?”*  
*Musk responded: “We’re not making a non-robo…,” before he was interrupted by another Tesla executive. Musk later added: “Basically, I think having a regular $25K model is pointless. It would be silly.”*  
*The April 5 Reuters article reported that Tesla had abandoned plans for an all-new, affordable mass-market EV but still planned a self-driving robotaxi. Since then, Musk has increasingly touted plans for robotaxis and autonomous vehicles.*  
*Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this story.*  
*On the October earnings call, Musk said that Tesla does plan a “$25K car” – its “Cybercab,” a two-door, two-seat, fully autonomous vehicle. Musk unveiled a prototype at a Hollywood-style event on Oct. 10.*  
*Musk says Tesla will start production of the Cybercab in 2026, after it deploys fully autonomous versions of its current Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Texas and California next year. The automaker faces steep technological, regulatory and legal challenges in delivering on Musk’s latest promises of fully autonomous vehicles, which echo others dating back about a decade.*  
*An all-new affordable Tesla for human drivers had until recently been a linchpin of Tesla’s strategy to become the world’s biggest automaker. For several years, Tesla had a goal of producing 20 million vehicles a year by 2030, more than tenfold what it sells now and nearly double that of Toyota, the current global sales leader. In May, Tesla dropped the 20-million goal from its latest “impact report” on progress toward sustainability goals.*  
*As recently as January of this year, Musk confirmed the plan for an all-new affordable EV in an earnings call. He said the next-generation vehicle would arrive in 2025 and launch a second major ""growth wave,” following the first wave with the release of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in 2017 and 2020, respectively.*  
*Investors and Tesla fans commonly called the anticipated cheap car a “Model 2,” slotting in below the Model 3, currently the least-expensive Tesla, starting at $42,490.*  
*In January, Musk described the all-new model as requiring “new revolutionary manufacturing technology.” But in April, after Reuters reported Tesla had scrapped the Model 2, Musk outlined a plan for “more affordable” models that could be produced “on the same manufacturing lines” as current Teslas.*  
*Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar Research Services analyst, said he believes these less-expensive vehicles will be built on current Tesla platforms and priced in the mid-$30,000s.*  
*“It was my understanding that the original plan was to make the more-affordable vehicle on a new platform,” he told Reuters. “I think Tesla realized they were late to making an affordable vehicle versus their Chinese-EV peers … So, they changed their strategy rather than make a large investment to produce a new vehicle.”*  
*After the April 5 Reuters report that Tesla had killed the Model 2, Musk posted that day on X saying Tesla planned a “robotaxi unveil” in August. The event, delayed until October and held on a movie set near Los Angeles, underwhelmed Wall Street and drove a 9% drop in Tesla shares the following day.*  
*Some investors viewed Musk’s comments on the Cybercab – along with displays of an autonomous “Robovan” concept and humanoid robots – as short on concrete details about the products. Tesla hasn’t said whether the Cybercab will feature new self-driving technology beyond the company’s “Full Self-Driving” feature in its current vehicles. Its existing models can’t fully drive themselves and require a human driver paying strict attention.*  
*The target market for the Cybercab isn’t clear. The Cybercab’s sports-car looks and two-door, two-seat configuration – a nearly extinct layout in the wider U.S. auto market – puzzled some analysts who expected a robotaxi with more room for passengers and luggage.*  
*Musk, in the October earnings call, said the concept vehicle’s design was “optimized for autonomy” and would also deliver affordability.*  
*“It will cost … roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car,” Musk said. “It just won't have a steering wheel and pedals.”*",2024-11-05,0.8537,Positive,"['EV', 'EV', 'EV', 'EV']"

Net sales climbed 24.7% to $2.29 billion, largely thanks to the company’s acquisitions of its largest U.S. Burger King franchisee and its Popeyes business in China earlier this year.

The company’s worldwide same-store sales grew just 0.3% in the quarter. Burger King, Firehouse Subs and Popeyes all reported same-store sales declines in their home markets.

Burger King’s same-store sales fell 0.7%. The chain is in the middle of a turnaround in the U.S., but consumers are also spending less at restaurants, reigniting the value wars between Burger King and its rivals.

Popeyes reported same-store sales declines of 4%. In June, the chain launched boneless wings as a permanent menu item for the first time in its history.

Firehouse Subs saw its same-store sales shrink 4.8% in the quarter. The sandwich chain is the latest addition to Restaurant Brands’ portfolio, as of 2021, and the smallest brand by footprint with just 1,300 locations as of the end of the third quarter.

Tim Hortons was the top performer, with domestic same-store sales growth of 2.3%. But the Canadian coffee chain still fell short of Wall Street’s same-store sales growth expectations of 4.1%, based on StreetAccount estimates.

Outside of the U.S. and Canada, Restaurant Brands’ international same-store sales rose 1.8% in the quarter, just shy of estimates of 2.2%.

Oil giant Saudi Aramco posts 15% drop in third-quarter profit but maintains dividend,1gk57du,Puginator,2024-11-05 17:40:39,127,0.97,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gk57du/oil_giant_saudi_aramco_posts_15_drop_in/,"Saudi state oil giant Aramco reported a 15.4% drop in net profit in the third-quarter on the back of “lower crude oil prices and weakening refining margins,” but maintained a 31.05 billion dividend.

The company reported net income of $27.56 billion in the July-September period, topping a company-provided estimate of $26.9 billion. The print is also a 5% drop from the previous quarter, which came in at $29.1 billion, as lower global oil prices, weaker demand and prolonged OPEC+ production cuts led by Saudi Arabia continue to impact crude prices.

The average selling price of oil for the second quarter of 2024 stood at $85 per barrel, but dropped to $78.7 per barrel during the third quarter, according to Saudi-based bank Al Rajhi capital, as non-OPEC supply volumes grew.

The oil firm said its year-on-year decline was partly offset by a “reduction in selling, administrative and general expenses primarily driven by a gain from derivative instruments, and a decrease in production royalties largely reflecting lower crude oil prices and a lower average effective royalty rate compared to the same quarter last year.”

Aramco’s dividend includes a base payout of $20.3 billion and an atypical performance-linked one of $10.8 billion. The Saudi government and the kingdom’s sovereign wealth vehicle, the Public Investment Fund, are the main beneficiaries of the dividend, holding stakes of roughly 81.5% and 16% in the company.

The remaining shareholding trades freely on Saudi Arabia’s Tadāwul stock exchange, with the company having finalized its second public share offering back in June.

Aramco’s earnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) came in at $51.45 billion in the third quarter, down 17% year-on-year. Aramco’s capital expenditure guidance was brought up 20% to $13.23 billion.

The company was trading at 27.45 riyals following the announcement, down 0.18% on the previous day.

The earnings align with a broader trend across oil majors, whose third-quarter profits have also suffered from declines in crude prices and refining margins. Aramco said it achieved average realized crude price of $79.3 per barrel in the third quarter, compared with $89.3 per barrel in the same period of last year.

Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter who produces roughly 9 million barrels per day of crude at present, serves as the de facto leader of the OPEC+ oil producers’ alliance, a subset of whom agreed over the weekend to delay a planned December output hike by one month.

“Aramco delivered robust net income and generated strong free cash flow during the third quarter, despite a lower oil price environment,” CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement. “We also progressed our upstream developments, strengthened our downstream value chain, and advanced our new energies program as we continue to invest through cycles.”

The revenues will be a boon to the Saudi economy, which is currently undergoing a diversification process under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s legacy Vision 2030 scheme spanning a slew of high-cost infrastructure “gigaprojects.”

Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Finance cut the kingdom’s growth forecast to 0.8% in 2024, in a steep decline from a previous projection of 4.4%, and raised the outlook for the national budgetary shortfall to roughly 2.9% of GDP, from a prior indication of 1.9%.

""" Boeing workers vote to accept deal, end strike """,1gk0wsl,AIONisMINE,2024-11-05 12:26:30,274,0.96,102,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gk0wsl/boeing_workers_vote_to_accept_deal_end_strike/,"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/04/business/boeing-strike-vote-hnk-intl/index.html


New York CNN  — 

Striking workers at embattled plane maker Boeing voted Monday to accept the company’s most recent offer, ending the costliest strike in the United States in more than 25 years.

The International Association of Machinists (IAM) said rank-and-file members voted by 59% to approve the deal. IAM members had voted almost unanimously against Boeing’s first offer on the eve of the start of the strike, and then 64% voted against the second offer less than two weeks ago, extending the strike.

“I’m proud of our members. It is a win,” said Jon Holden, president of the largest IAM local at Boeing and the union’s chief negotiator. “They achieved a lot, and we’re ready to move forward.”

Asked what prompted a positive vote this time after two previous rejections, Holden told reporters: “Members are ready, ready to come back. I look forward to getting them back to work.”

Boeing said it was pleased with the outcome.

“While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team,” CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a statement. “We will only move forward by listening and working together. There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.”

The 33,000 union members, who have been on strike since September 13, will start returning to work Wednesday.

The deal calls for an immediate raise of 13% and raises of 9% for each of the next two years, and then another 7% in the fourth and final year of the contract. Taken together, members will receive a pay raise that exceeds 43%.

Workers also get a ratification bonus of $12,000, part of which they can contribute to 401(k) retirement accounts. But the deal did not restore the traditional pension plan they lost in 2014 from their previous labor deal.

Workers’ continued anger at the loss of that pension plan was seen as a major factor in the rejection of Boeing’s (BA) previous two offers and had raised uncertainty about the outcome of Monday’s vote.
Pension problem

Holden acknowledged the pension was likely a major issue for many of the 41% who voted against the deal.

“Fifty-nine percent is a lot, but there are definitely those who were not happy with the agreement,” he said. “Many of the members were fighting to get the pensions back. It’s a righteous fight.”

Companies, both unionized and nonunion, have generally moved away from a traditional pension plan, known as defined benefit plans, in recent decades. Such plans generally pay retirees a set amount every month no matter how long they live, or how well pension fund assets perform.

Such plans place the risk with the companies. For that reason, defined benefit plans are only available to about 8% of US workers in the private sector today, according to data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. That compares to 39% in 1980.

Boeing employees have what’s known as a defined contribution plan, such as 401(k) plans, where the company’s obligations end after it contributes to the individual workers’ account. Boeing agreed to increase the contributions it was making to those accounts, but refused to go back to the defined benefit plan as the union and many members had demanded.

“Our members deserve pensions just like every worker deserves a safe, fair retirement in the future,” Holden said Monday following the vote. “They weren’t wrong in feeling the way they did. I agree with them. We just couldn’t get the pension out of this company. We’ll continue working on that issue.”
Leadership support

Union leadership had urged members to accept the latest offer, even though it was not significantly different from the one they rejected on October 23. The union had urged members “to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,” and warned members that another rejection could “risk a regressive or lesser offer in the future.”

The strikers have lost more than $600 million in combined wages but the cost to Boeing has been significantly greater, according to estimates from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based research firm, which puts Boeing’s losses through the end of last week at $6.5 billion. Overall, the cost to the US economy has topped $11.5 billion.

Those losses come on top of the nearly $40 billion in core operating losses that Boeing has reported since two fatal crashes led to a 20-month grounding of its best-selling jet, the 737 Max, in 2019 and 2020. The company has already warned that its losses would continue through at least the end of 2025 no matter how quickly the strike ended.

But despite the deep financial problems, Boeing had little choice but to settle the strike and get the workers back on the job. The strike has choked off its major source of revenue, since it gets most of the cash from the sale of commercial jets at the time it is delivered to airlines. Deliveries of all 737 Max planes as well as freighter models have been halted by the strike.

The wages that Boeing pays to its workers make up far less than 10% of its overall cost of producing a plane, with most of the cost going into raw materials and purchases from suppliers who produce everything from avionics to the fuselage of the planes themselves.
Boeing’s economic impact

Despite its problems, Boeing is still a major contributor to the US economy, as it is the largest American exporter.

The strike has caused problems and layoffs at many of Boeing’s 10,000 suppliers, which are spread across all 50 states. Boeing estimates its own annual contribution to the US economy at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million jobs directly and indirectly. It has 150,000 US employees, including the strikers.

View Comments

The Labor Department’s latest monthly employment report showed that 44,000 jobs were impacted in October, counting not just the 33,000 strikers, but also workers at Boeing and its suppliers who aren’t on strike but have been temporarily laid off as the strike halts commercial aircraft manufacturing at the aviation giant entirely.

There have been short-term problems for airlines, too. While they’ve been able to continue to fly the Boeing planes already in their fleets, promised deliveries of new jets have come to a halt. And that delay comes on top of ongoing delays, due to questions about the quality and safety of Boeing jets.

Those problems were worsened by a January incident in which a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines jet soon after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in its fuselage. Investigators discovered Boeing had delivered the plane without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place.

Ending the strike is important for Boeing’s Ortberg, who started in the job just five weeks before the strike began. He has said he wants to “reset” the company’s relationship with the union.

The Overlooked Risk in AI Stocks: It Has to Do With Data,1gjfea0,MarshallGrover,2024-11-04 19:52:37,66,0.88,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gjfea0/the_overlooked_risk_in_ai_stocks_it_has_to_do/,"Hi, everyone. I'm not formally trained in computer science or finance. I'm just someone who is passionate about the transformative potential of AI, financial markets and investing, among other topics.   
  
I've been working on an ""investment thesis"" of sorts (shown below) that involves a potential risk that seems to be somewhat overlooked in discussions about AI stocks. I am sharing it here in the hope that it might spark some interesting and fruitful conversation, particularly among those more experienced in the field of AI.  


**The Overlooked Risk in AI Stocks:** While investors focus on the AI hardware race and GPU shortages, a more fundamental challenge looms: the growing scarcity of high-quality, diverse data for training advanced AI systems, particularly AGI. This overlooked bottleneck could significantly impact AI company valuations and the timeline for AGI development (if it can be achieved at all).  
  
**Current Market Narrative**  
◾Investors fixate on computing power, driving up valuations of hardware-focused companies.  
◾The prevailing logic: more GPUs equal more AI capability and value, which overlooks a critical flaw in the race towards AGI.  
  
**The Real Bottleneck**  
AI performance, especially for AGI aspirations, hinges on three data factors:  
◾ Quality: Accuracy and reliability  
◾Quantity: Volume of useful examples  
◾Diversity: Range of scenarios represented  
  
While data quantity grows exponentially, we face a 'data wall' - the supply of high-quality, novel, human-generated data becoming insufficient for advanced AI training and development. This poses critical risks:  
◾Closed-loop AI content generation leading to digital entropy and degraded data quality/diversity  
◾Amplification of biases and errors in AI outputs  
◾Fundamental limitations on achieving true general intelligence  
  
Emerging AI techniques like few-shot learning offer potential ways to scale this data wall but may not fully address the complex data needs for AGI development. Notably, while synthetic data can augment datasets, it cannot replace the richness and variability of real-world data essential for true understanding.  
  
**Key Takeaways:**  
◾ Data scarcity is a critical risk in AI investment.  
◾ The ""data wall"" limits advancements in AI/AGI.  
◾ Quality, Quantity, and Diversity of data are essential for AI performance.  
◾ Emerging techniques may help but have limitations.  
◾ Synthetic data cannot fully substitute for real-world data.

**Overvaluation Risks**  
◾ Companies valued primarily on computational capacity  
◾ Firms lacking robust data acquisition strategies  
◾ Businesses dependent on public/synthetic data  
  
**Hidden Opportunities**  
◾ Companies with unique data access  
◾ Firms innovating in data collection and curation  
◾ Enterprises focused on diverse, high-quality datasets crucial for AGI  
  
**Regulatory Considerations**  
◾ Evolving privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) create new challenges  
◾ Data access restrictions limit large-scale dataset use  
◾ Cross-border data flow regulations risk creating regional ""data silos""  
◾ Demands for algorithmic transparency necessitate diverse, well-documented training data  
  
**Investment Framework**  
**Key Questions:**  
◾ What’s their data sourcing strategy for advanced AI and potential AGI?  
◾ Do they have unique high-quality data access?  
◾ How sustainable is their data advantage in the AGI race?   
◾ What if data becomes the primary constraint for AGI achievement?  
  
**Risk Indicators:**  
◾ Over-reliance on public datasets  
◾ Lack of proprietary data sources  
◾ Limited data diversity for general intelligence tasks  
◾ No clear data quality maintenance strategy  
  
**Portfolio Implications**  
**Large Cap AI Stocks:**  
◾ Reassess hardware-centric valuations  
◾ Seek evidence of sustainable data advantages for AI development  
◾ Consider data quality risk exposure in long-term AI/AGI strategies  
  
**Emerging Players:**  
◾ Identify genuine data moat builders with AGI potential  
◾ Seek innovative data acquisition approaches for general intelligence  
◾ Prioritize quality and diversity over mere quantity  
  
**The Long View**

New York Times adds fewer digital subscribers as spending tightens,1gjexjg,Puginator,2024-11-04 19:32:06,162,0.89,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gjexjg/new_york_times_adds_fewer_digital_subscribers_as/,"New York Times posted fewer-than-expected digital subscribers for the third quarter as readers cut back on spending in an uncertain economy, offsetting strong growth in advertising sales.

The company added 260,000 digital-only subscribers, compared with 300,000 additions in the previous quarter. Analysts expected the company to add 280,200 subscribers, according to Visible Alpha.

Heightened political advertising in the lead up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election helped the company’s ad revenue of $118.4 million beat analysts’ estimates of $116.93 million, according to data compiled by LSEG.

It reported total revenue of $640.2 million, compared with estimates of $640.8 million.

New York Times forecast subscription revenues to grow by 7% to 9% in the fourth quarter, slightly below expectations for 8.2% growth.

Revenue from sports news site The Athletic, purchased by the New York Times in 2022, jumped 29.8% to $44.7 million from $34.4 million a year ago.

everybody was writing about it. So I thought: I want to see what English speakers think about it. And there was nothing. I bought shares and 1 call. Thinking once they translate the news, market will react. I am already waiting a week. And nothing. When I look at Yahoo finance nothing happened at all. When I look at seeking alpha or IBKR. One simple article, no analysis or discussion.

20% of SMR company has been bought by corporation which has almost monopoly for energy in Czech republic (because it would be illegal to have perfect monopoly). ČEZ talks about need to build up to 10 SMR to replace coal heat/power plants in coming years. ČEZ has recently also bought Škoda JS (Škoda nuclear engineering). That company has produced nuclear reactors in the past. And still has all the tools and facilities to produce nuclear reactors. They have “unused” reactor hall which is currently producing storage units for spent nuclear fuel, because nobody orders reactors today. RR is producing SMR design to be build in factory. ČEZ owns a factory for nuclear reactors in middle of EU. And no one speaks about the synergy. 

Reaction of the market, whole weak of nothing -1%. As if there were no news. So it got me thinking, how often this happens? Do you know any other example of events which has vastly different information availability or point of view based on language?

I've been diving deep into the healthcare and defense sector as of late. I found defense much easier to understand as a former military member who dealt directly with most products.

However the healthcare sector has been very tricky. On one hand I look at kvue for their strong branding like tylenol but with the less than attractive valuation & single digit growth projections it's left me searching elsewhere.

The issue I see is I don't find anyone has a moat, novo nordisq was appealing but from what I've gathered their market share on a lot of their product is compromised rather quickly. Ozempic is a strong product but how secure is that product?

I have found other niche such as eye care or senior living reits but nothing quite attracted me.

If you yourself know of companies within the healthcare sector who has a moat I'd love to hear it. Or if there's any healthcare company you have in your portfolio let me know. I'll be doing my own valuation & analysis but suggestions are more than welcomed.",2024-11-03,0.9878,Positive,[]

SnowFlake’s Stock Buyback and Short-Term Optimism,1gi7s8w,krogerCoffee,2024-11-03 03:38:46,21,0.69,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gi7s8w/snowflakes_stock_buyback_and_shortterm_optimism/,"Snowflake recently issued two billion dollars in zero-percent-interest convertible senior notes due in 2027 and 2029, which reflects a high level of confidence from both management and investors about the company’s short-term growth potential. Here’s a breakdown of what this move means and why Snowflake might be taking this route:

The cash from this debt issuance will partially fund a stock buyback program, reducing the number of shares on the market, which often has the effect of lifting stock price by making shares scarcer. By buying back shares, Snowflake is aiming to support the stock price in the short term, potentially improving per-share earnings and appealing to investors.

So, why take on this debt if it’s going toward share buybacks? Snowflake’s move suggests they’re anticipating significant growth in the near future, likely from strong revenue and demand for their data cloud services. With the convertible notes carrying no interest payments, Snowflake doesn’t need to worry about traditional debt servicing costs. Investors instead receive an option to convert these notes into Snowflake stock, but only if the share price climbs to a level that makes the conversion profitable.

A key detail here is that these notes have a 40% conversion premium, meaning investors would only convert their notes to stock if Snowflake’s price rises significantly above current levels. If this happens, the notes convert into shares, giving Snowflake a financial cushion now without immediate dilution for existing shareholders. They also implemented a capped call transaction to reduce the risk of dilution even if the stock does convert later on.

Essentially, this move aligns with a high-confidence outlook from Snowflake’s management. They seem to believe they’ll perform well enough in the short term to drive up their stock price and make this financing favorable for the company. This strategy could provide Snowflake with more flexibility for acquisitions, product investment, and even future stock or debt issuances at more favorable terms if their market valuation continues to rise.

While it’s a bold move, it’s not without risk. If Snowflake’s growth doesn’t match expectations, they’ll have taken on significant debt without the offsetting benefit of a higher stock price. But the confidence expressed in their growth trajectory—particularly in a competitive data market—is telling, and if they can execute their strategy effectively, this could be a smart way to support their stock while preparing for further expansion.",2024-11-03,0.9937,Positive,[]
Globalstar and Apple expanded partnership ,1gi2s7x,Stevitop,2024-11-02 23:50:38,32,0.85,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gi2s7x/globalstar_and_apple_expanded_partnership/,"Does anyone have anymore information on Globalstar GSAT and Apple AAPL expanded partnership? Is GSAT a buy after the 40% rise in share price?.

Here is some information I have , but is there anything I should be aware of ? 

The expanded partnership between Globalstar (GSAT) and Apple (APL) could bring significant long-  term benefits to Globalstar's stock, though some challenges may stil lie ahead.  
Potential Positive Impacts  I. Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partners. p heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to zero.
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  industries (e.g. maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple.
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partnership heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to  Apple's needs and future directions. If Apple shifts its strategic focus away from satellite  communication, Globalstar's revenue and stock could be negatively affected,  
2. Execution Risks: Globalstar must deliver the new MSS network according to Apple's  performance milestones. Failing to meet these milestones could result in reduced or delayed  payments, which would likely impact the stock negatively.
In the near term, Globalstar's stock may experience heightened volatility, as its year-to-date  performance has already been variable. However, if Globalstar manages this partnership successfully.  it could see sustained growth, especially as satelite connectivity becomes increasingly relevant to  tech giants like Apple.

Etsy's declining gross merchandising sales - from a buyer,1ghl0zv,ABCXYZ12345679,2024-11-02 06:36:14,71,0.83,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ghl0zv/etsys_declining_gross_merchandising_sales_from_a/,"Etsy reported a 6% decline in gross merchandising sales in the third quarter. Active buyers decreased as well as habitual buyers.

I can tell you one of the reasons why (a contributing factor). I have been a buyer on Etsy since 2016. I am also a seller. I cannot purchase multiple items on Etsy say more than 10 items at a time because of Etsy's faulty cart. This has been the case for at least a couple of years. I first started having the problem in my main shop a couple of years ago.

I buy a lot of jewelry supplies so I can easily purchase many items at once and have. I am a habitual buyer who has probably spent approximately $40k maybe more on Etsy all these years.

I started using a second account to purchase because the constant popups in the shop I sell on are too annoying. Many sellers/buyers report the same. Etsy does not care.

Anyway, in my second account I have been trying to add items to my cart (all beads) to purchase from this one shop. I would have bought from them elsewhere if they had their own site but they do not.

Last Sunday I spent a couple of hours looking through the shops over 2000 listings. They have awesome beads and shopping is fun for me. The first time around that is. Thereafter, it is no longer fun and now like work. I added the items on Sunday. I came back on Monday to purchase and I could not access my cart. I contact support who said I would get an email. I did not. I contacted them the next day and asked if they were going to fix my cart. They told me they thought it was a problem with 14 items in the saved for later. I specifically told Etsy support DO NOT remove the 97 items in my cart, but you could the saved for later.

The next day to my surprise the cart was fixed. But Etsy removed those 97 items in my cart that I wanted to buy! That was time consuming. The problem is that some buyers are not able to add more than 10 items in their cart at a time to purchase, but the cart allows up to 100. I was upset. Support gave me a $20 credit for the inconvenience.

As it is now like work for me and not fun I go to add the items back in my cart and it is quite time consuming. I did make two purchases earlier today but they were not more than 5 items. I figured I could add up to not more than 40 items and be good. At 38 items my cart glitched out and I cannot access the cart!

I contact support again tonight and told them this. Support was able to get the items down to 20 in my cart to where it works. So it seems I can safely purchase 20 items. But I will have to do a multiple item purchase for all I want to buy. Support gave me another $10 credit. They claim Etsy is trying to fix this problem for buyers.

Most buyers would not persist as I have. Most buyers would move on elsewhere to Amazon, Ebay, etc. And most probably do.

Sellers are losing out on sales and so is Etsy because Etsy is incapable of fixing this cart issue. They don't care.

For 5 days I have tried to purchase a large amount of beads from this one shop and still trying! I have written the COO twice this past week. I probably wrote management a couple of years ago when it happened. They know about it.

I have been buying on Amazon as a prime member for several years. I have been buying on Ebay since 2016. I have NEVER experienced a glitch or malfunction on those marketplaces ever! It is always a seamless experience as a buyer and seller. Etsy has daily glitches and malfunctions. If Amazon and Ebay can do it why can't Etsy?

And accessing support as a buyer and seller is quite difficult. I can imagine the average buyer is not going to take the time to try to get through the maze to access support thus they abandon Etsy.

I can imagine how much manpower and $ Etsy has spent fixing buyers cart issues and credits they are issuing. Rather than just fixing the problem once and for all so the cart functions normally and seamlessly.

Don't even get me started on seller's pain points, there are many of them as well.

The moral of this story is do you want to invest in a company that can't have a functioning cart and treats their buyers and sellers like they do? They don't care obviously that they are losing sales since this has gone on for a long, long time.

The switch will take place on Nov. 8. In a separate move, Sherwin Williams will replace Dow Inc in the average as well, S&P Global said in a statement.

Shares of Nvidia have climbed over 180% so far in 2024 as investors have seen the company as the primary beneficiary of the AI boom.

On the other hand, Intel shares have fallen 51% so far this year as the company struggles with manufacturing, new competition for its central processors, and the impression that it has missed out on the AI trend.

Two that really caught my eye were Dollar Tree(DLTR) & Dollar General (DG).. 

Both are essential 52 week lows and fell 50% from highs and couple of months ago. You may ask, why? Well a couple of factors. Earnings weren't so hot. Mainly from eeconomic headwinds.. margin compression, and competition from the likes of walmart.

Individually each has a weakness in their own right. DG typically looking ratchet and prices higher than others. DLTR with their recent purchase of family dollar not working as well as they'd like.

Now, why are these potentially a awesome place to park your money? 

First off, much cheaper than just a few months ago. 2nd and most likely the catalyst.. a economic recession. 

We are getting closer to one as each day passes. We all saw the jobs report this morn. I feel like the lack of sales stems from the poor getting to poor to shop there but as a recession looms we will see the pivot from those who went to target supermarket to a dollar store.

> BlackRock’s iShares is trying to appeal to investors who want to diversify beyond from the so-called Magnificent Seven. The firm launched the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT) this month. It doesn’t just hold the Magnificent Seven — Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. It’s made up of the 20 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization. “What the iShares build ETFs are designed to do is to deliver a tool kit of simple solutions for investors to be able to capture the growth of some of the largest companies within the U.S. equity market today, but to do so in a broader and more diversified manner,” BlackRock’s Rachel Aguirre told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” on Monday.

> Aguirre, the firm’s head of U.S. iShares product, noted the ETF’s mission is to deliver an easy and accessible way to tap into the innovation of megacaps – “whether that be in the tech-heavy Nasdaq space or, more broadly, within the S&P [500].” The ETF, according to Aguirre, provides a way for investors worried about the concentration of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the S&P 500.

> On Thursday, the Magnificent Seven slid more than 3.5% as a group — losing around $615 billion in market cap. That’s equivalent to the size of JPMorgan Chase. However, the Magnificent Seven is still up about 43% so far year while the S&P 500 is up around 20% “It’s important for clients and investors to remember that there are split views on this topic. There are many investors who believe that the big will get bigger [and] that the winners will continue to win,” Aguirre said. “There’s also another side to this argument. There are many investors who believe that it’s actually a very worrisome time to continue investing in… mega-cap companies because of just their high valuations.”",2024-11-01,0.9752,Positive,"['ETF', 'TOPT', 'CNBC', 'ETF', 'ETF', 'ETF']"

&#x200B;

*Job creation in October slowed to its weakest pace since late 2020 as the impacts of storms in the Southeast and a significant labor impasse dented the employment picture.*

*Nonfarm payrolls increased by 12,000 for the month, down sharply from September and below the Dow Jones estimate for 100,000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. In what had already been expected to be a downbeat report, October posted the smallest gain since December 2020.*

*The unemployment rate, however, held at 4.1%, in line with expectations. A broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons also was unchanged at 7.7%.*

*In the report narrative, the BLS noted that the Boeing strike likely subtracted 44,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector, which lost 46,000 positions overall.*

&#x200B;

*Along with that, the report noted the impact of hurricanes Helene and Milton but said “it is not possible to quantify the net effect” of the storms on the jobs total.*

*Elsewhere, the bureau said average hourly earnings increased 0.4% for the month, slightly higher than the estimate, though the 4% 12-month gain was in line. The average work week held steady at 34.3 hours.*

*Markets, though, largely ignored the bad news, with stock market futures poised for a strong open on Wall Street while Treasury yields plunged. The meager jobs numbers along with wages about in line with expectations help cement another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week.*

&#x200B;

*The release comes just days ahead of the presidential election in which Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump are in what most polls show to be a deadlocked race. With the economy at the forefront of the battle, the light jobs number “casts a murky shadow heading into next week,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.*

*The weak October report also included substantial downward revisions from previous months. August was cut to just a gain of 78,000 while September’s initial estimate came down to 223,000. Together, the net revisions lowered previously reported job creation totals by 112,000.*

&#x200B;

*Health care and government again led job creation, respectively adding 52,000 and 40,000 positions. Several sectors, though, saw job losses.*

*In addition to the expected pullback in manufacturing, temporary help services saw a drop of 49,000. The category is sometimes seen as a proxy for underlying job strength and has seen a decline of 577,000 since March 2022, the BLS said.*

*Another leading sector, leisure and hospitality, saw a drop of 4,000, while retail trade and transportation and warehousing also reported modest declines.*

*The report covers a month in which hurricanes Helene and Milton slammed the Southeast – Florida and North Carolina in particular – while the Boeing strike also hit what had been a vibrant though slowing labor market. Recent developments indicate that the Boeing impasse, which sidelined some 44,000 workers, could be near an end.*

*Prior to the release, job creation had averaged close to 200,000 a month during 2024, about 60,000 below the pace for the same period a year ago through still indicative of solid pace of hiring.*

*Some cracks in recent months have raised concerns at the Federal Reserve that while the year-over-year pace of inflation is slowing, elevated interest rate could impact the labor market and threaten the ongoing economic expansion.*

*As a result, policymakers in September took a step unprecedented for a growing economy and lowered their benchmark short-term interest rate by half a percentage point, double the customary quarter-point increments in which the Fed usually likes to move.*

*Financial markets are pricing in a strong likelihood that the central bank cuts by a quarter point at each of its two remaining meetings this year. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will announce its decision next Thursday.*",2024-11-01,0.9915,Positive,"['BLS', 'MLS', 'BLS']"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Amazon CEO pledges AI investments will pay off as capital expenditures surge 81%,1ggtl3k,Puginator,2024-11-01 06:14:41,404,0.93,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ggtl3k/amazon_ceo_pledges_ai_investments_will_pay_off_as/,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is trying to reassure investors who may be worried about the future payoff of the company’s massive investments in generative artificial intelligence.

On a conference call with analysts following the company’s third-quarter earnings report on Thursday, Jassy pointed to the success of Amazon’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, which has become a crucial profit engine despite the extreme costs associated with building data centers.

“I think we’ve proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business,” Jassy said. “We expect the same thing will happen here with generative AI.”

Amazon spent $22.6 billion on property and equipment during the quarter, up 81% from the year before. Jassy said Amazon plans to spend $75 billion on capex in 2024 and expects an even higher number in 2025.

The jump in spending is primarily being driven by generative AI investments, Jassy said. The company is rushing to invest in data centers, networking gear and hardware to meet vast demand for the technology, which has exploded in popularity since OpenAI released its ChatGPT assistant almost two years ago.

“It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity,” Jassy said. “And I think our customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long term that we’re aggressively pursuing it.”

AI spending was a big topic on tech earnings calls this week. Meta on Wednesday raised its capital expenditures guidance, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was “quite happy” with the team’s execution. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI weighed on its fiscal first-quarter earnings released on Wednesday, and the company said capital spending would continue to rise. A day earlier, Alphabet CFO Anat Ashkenazi warned the company expects capital spending to grow in 2025.

Amazon has said its cloud unit has picked up more business from companies that need infrastructure to deploy generative AI models. It’s also launched several AI products for enterprises, third-party sellers on its marketplace and advertisers in recent months. The company is expected to announce a souped-up version of its Alexa voice assistant that incorporates generative AI, something Jassy said will arrive “in the near future.”

Amazon hasn’t disclosed its revenue from generative AI, but Jassy said Thursday it’s become a “multi-billion-dollar revenue run rate” business within AWS that “continues to grow at a triple-digit year-over-year percentage.”

“It’s growing more than three times faster at this stage of its evolution as AWS itself grew, and we felt like AWS grew pretty quickly,” he added.

The stock lost 15.3%, its biggest drop since May 2022, when it fell 19.5%. A broader market decline also pressured Coinbase.

Other crypto-related stocks fell as well. Robinhood, which also reported weak earnings Wednesday, tumbled 16%. Miners Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms slid 8% and 11%, respectively.

Bitcoin, which is often a big influence on the price of Coinbase, slid 2.78% to $69,918.66 after hovering below its all-time high of $73,000 this week.

Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities, chalked it up to a temporary unwind in crypto-related names and called it an opportunity for longer-term focused investors in Coinbase and Robinhood.

“There is a lot that’s going to happen here over the next couple months – \[like\] the U.S. election \[and\] ramifications of that – that will be become the much bigger story for the space, not to mention the recent appreciation in crypto prices and volume could put upward pressure on fourth-quarter revenue if the trend continues over the next two months,” said Ryan, who has an outperform rating on Coinbase.

“Near-term, people will have to recalibrate a bit in their models for the blended take rate assumption,” or the percentage of revenue Coinbase keeps from a transaction, he said. “Nothing structural occurred here, but as stablecoin trading volume has increased, that comes at a lower spread, and the fourth-quarter implied revenue guide was a bit soft.”

Owen Lau, an analyst at Oppenheimer with a buy rating on Coinbase, put Thursday’s drop on the warning that subdued volume could persist going forward and that lower U.S. interest rates could cut into the growth of Coinbase’s stablecoin revenue.

Even Google has given up its 5% gain from yesterday. Matching the drop, the VIX closed at 23.16, and the 10-year Treasury Yield closed about the same at 4.29%. 

Should Apple and Amazon disappoint post-market today, I think a correction could be on. The main bullish factor countering a volatile election week, a VIX over 23 and high yields of 4.3% is strong earnings, especially from the M-7. Clearly, that doesn’t seem to be happening.

Meta  - Initially, it seemed like a perfunctory one percent drop on a small beat and in-line guidance, but it’s gone a lot further as Meta is down 4% to 570.

**Why the rout?** Analysts and investors panned high Capex plans of $40Bn and costly high-risk bets such as Meta’s Reality Labs unit, (the developer of augmented and virtual reality technologies), which logged a staggering operating loss of $4.4 billion 

Microsoft - (down 6% to $408) is getting clobbered for a different reason. Even as Azure grew 34%, the pace wasn’t enough, and guidance of 31% to 32% in constant currency was lower than expected. However, this is due to supply chain constraints as President Amy Hood noted that the 1 or 2-point deceleration Microsoft has guided is mainly due to some supply pushouts, in terms of AI supply coming online that the company counted on. (Read, not as many Blackwells/Hoppers as they would have liked)

""We expect consumption growth to be stable compared to Q1, and we expect to add more sequential dollars to Azure than any other quarter in history,"" Hood added.

The indomitable Dan Ives of Wedbush remains as bullish as ever…

""We actually disagree with this initial take as the new Azure reporting standards have moved Street numbers all around and a slight deceleration is totally expected by many investors with some supply constraints and reacceleration in 2H25, and we would be strong buyers of MSFT on any weakness this morning,"" Wedbush analysts, led by Daniel Ives, said in a note.",2024-11-01,0.6705,Positive,"['VIX', 'VIX', 'AI', 'MSFT']"

"Intel shares pop 12% on earnings beat, uplifting guidance",1ggnzbb,Puginator,2024-11-01 01:46:56,517,0.94,192,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ggnzbb/intel_shares_pop_12_on_earnings_beat_uplifting/,"Intel shares jumped 12% in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected revenue and issued quarterly guidance that topped expectations.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** Loss of 46 cents adjusted
* **Revenue:** $13.28 billion vs. $13.02 billion expected

Intel’s revenue declined 6% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Sept. 28, according to a statement. The company registered a net loss of $16.99 billion, or $3.88 per share, compared with net earnings of $310 million, or 7 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

As part of its cost reduction plan, Intel recognized $2.8 billion in restructuring charges during the quarter. There were also $15.9 billion in impairment charges.

Intel has been mired in an extended slump due to market share losses in its core businesses and an inability to crack artificial intelligence. CEO Pat Gelsinger revealed plans during the quarter to turn the company’s foundry business into an independent subsidiary, a move that would enable outside funding options.

CNBC reported that Intel had engaged advisors to defend itself against activist investors. In late September, news surfaced that Qualcomm reached out to Intel about a possible takeover.

The Client Computing Group that sells PC chips recorded $7.33 billion in revenue, down about 7% from a year earlier and below the $7.39 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

Revenue from the Data Center and AI segment came to $3.35 billion, which was up about 9% and more than the $3.17 billion consensus from StreetAccount.

Intel called for fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 12 cents per share and revenue between $13.3 billion and $14.3 billion. Analysts had expected 8 cents in adjusted earnings per share and $13.66 billion in revenue.

During the quarter, Intel announced the launch of Xeon 6 server processors and Gaudi artificial intelligence accelerators.

As of Thursday’s close, Intel shares were down about 57% in 2024, while the S&P 500 index had gained 20%.

ENVX: why I like the stock,1ggjwxd,tostitostiesto,2024-10-31 22:52:59,16,0.75,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ggjwxd/envx_why_i_like_the_stock/,"ENVX and why it will moon

ENVX (Enovix) is an advanced lithium-ion silicon battery manufacturer, and is a first mover with it's battery. They already have 2 smartphone OEMs lined up for 2025, and they just finished their fab2 in Malaysia. They have a patent to protect their proprietary process behind their silicon batteries. They are the first to use 100% active silicon batteries in the consumer market. Competitors cannot just spin up a fab easily.

They are positioned to ramp up production in 2025 with profits coming in early 2026.

They recently raised $100m via stockholder dilution, out of their 168m total outstanding shares. This is roughly only 6% dilution. As of today, their share price has dropped 19%. The $100m dilution along with $200m cash on hand, allows them to survive for 6 more quarters at a minimum, assuming they still continue to burn $50m in cash per quarter, without *any* efficiency gains. That positions that well for the beginning of 2026 play. More partnerships, more customers, lower CAPEX, different segments of customers, will all drive the price up. 

Next-gen batteries and EVs and component manufacturers are a long-term play

I believe ENVX is currently underpriced. As of current price $8.45, my EOY price target is $12, and by end of next year, I see $18 at a minimum.",2024-10-31,0.9777,Positive,"['ENVX', 'ENVX', 'CAPEX', 'ENVX', 'EOY']"
Alphabet Deserves A Better Valuation,1ggjotg,Fountainheadusa,2024-10-31 22:43:27,331,0.86,166,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ggjotg/alphabet_deserves_a_better_valuation/,"**I had recommended Alphabet (GOOG)** [**as a great long-term buy at $150**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anr3id/alphabet_goog_150_looks_like_an_excellent_long/), several months ago.

Last evening, Google knocked it out of the park with really stellar results. I bought more shares this morning, and am reiterating a Buy.

I believe analysts’ consensus earnings could be a little conservative and Google should continue to beat estimates with better growth and operating margins.

Google's earnings quality is better than several tech giants for the following reasons.

* It has a near monopoly in Search
* Market leadership in media with YouTube.
* A strong first-mover advantage with Waymo.
* A fast-growing Google Cloud business, third only to and catching up with Azure and AWS.

**Its earnings and growth are sustainable, thus it deserves a better valuation and multiple.**

Let's take a closer look at Q3 earnings.

Q3 GAAP EPS came in at $2.12 per share, beating expectations of $1.85 per share $0.27, or 14% - **This was a substantial beat.**

Revenue of $88.3Bn (+14.9% Y/Y) beat by $2.05B or 3%.

Consolidated Alphabet revenues in Q3 2024 increased 15%, or 16% in constant currency, YoY to $88.3Bn reflecting strong momentum across the business.

Google Services revenues increased 13% to $76.5 billion, led by strength across Google Search & other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and YouTube ads.

**Total operating income increased 34% and operating margin percent jumped a huge 4.5% to 32%.**

Google Cloud revenues grew a whopping 35% to $11.4Bn led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products, **with record operating margins of 17%** as the cost per AI query decreased by 90% over the past 18 months.

Cloud titans Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) have commanded huge valuations for their cloud computing businesses; with Google Cloud growing at 35%, it should continue to narrow the gap over the next 5 years. Also importantly, AWS and Azure have operating margins over 30%, and should Google continue to scale and leverage their existing fixed costs, they can reach the same margins. I also believe as they get better at AI, they should be able to charge more.

Based on consensus analysts’ estimates Alphabet’s EPS should grow to $11.60 in 2027 from $5.80 in 2023 - that’s an annual growth rate of 18%. Comparatively, Apple‘s estimated EPS growth through FY2027 is slower at 14%, and it sports a P/E of 33 compared to Google’s 22. Alphabet’s P/E is closer to the S&P 500’s P/E of 21!

I believe this is too low, and there is a lot of potential for its stock to appreciate on the lower valuation.

Besides the strong EPS, a lot of Google’s expenses are noncash depreciation and amortization and their cash flow margins are strong. They generated operating cash of $31Bn on $88Bn last quarter, or a 35% cash flow margin.

The antitrust regulation will remain a possible negative on Alphabet, but the final decision is still years away as Alphabet vigorously appeals the decision.

**I recommend Alphabet as a buy at $176**",2024-10-31,0.9868,Positive,"['GOOG', 'AWS', 'GAAP', 'EPS', 'GCP', 'AI', 'AI', 'GCP', 'AI', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AI', 'EPS', 'EPS', 'EPS']"

Comcast is exploring separation of cable business,1ggejeb,Puginator,2024-10-31 18:59:06,125,0.93,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ggejeb/comcast_is_exploring_separation_of_cable_business/,"Comcast is exploring a separation of its cable networks business, President Mike Cavanagh said Thursday.

During the company’s third-quarter earnings call with investors, Cavanagh said the company is exploring creating “a new, well-capitalized company owned by our shareholders and comprised of our strong portfolio of cable networks.”

The possible separation would not include broadcast network NBC nor streaming service Peacock, he added. NBCUniversal’s cable networks portfolio includes Bravo, E!, Syfy, Oxygen True Crime, USA Network, as well as news networks MSNBC and CNBC.

The company lost 365,000 cable TV customers during the third quarter.

“Like many of our peers in media, we are experiencing the effects of the transition in our video businesses and have been studying the best path forward for these assets,” Cavanagh said.

“We are not ready to talk about any specifics yet, but we’ll be back to you as and when we reach firm conclusions,” he said.

Shares of Comcast were up more than 6% in premarket trading.

The comments come as millions of customers continue to flee the traditional pay TV bundle in favor of streaming. Comcast has been beefing up Peacock, which got a boost during the third quarter when it exclusively aired the Summer Olympics in Paris.

$UBER is positioned extremely well for the future,1ggehhq,DrixGod,2024-10-31 18:56:37,0,0.49,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ggehhq/uber_is_positioned_extremely_well_for_the_future/,"At the time of writing this post, UBER is down 7% in premarket, which is a big overreaction, after their earnings report. I suspect the cause of the drop is the miss on Bookings, which is not significant in my opinion.

Key factors:

- EPS of $1.20, beating expectations of $0.41

- Revenue of $11.2B, beating expectations of $11B

- Total Gross Bookings of $41B, missing expectations of $43B

UBER had a record quarter, for the first time it generated an all time high GAAP operating profits of more than $1B.

In the conference call the CEO and CFO reiterated that they have a very high standard for doing M&A, so the Expedia deal is not set in stone, rather just a rumor.

They've also stated they are looking to reduce share count in 2025, meaning doing share buybacks, which will in turn drive higher share price.

But what I want to talk mostly about is the AV section.

**AV**

The AV (Autonomous vehicle or self driving cars) is a hot topic right now, especially after Teslas event. Despite Tesla being clearly very far behind actual FSD, Waymo is doing AV, and doing it good. They are partenered with UBER and the AV fleet actually had the highest rated score on the platform (as mentioned by their CEO in the earnings call). Beside Waymo, they are partenered with 14 AV companies, including Aurora which they also have a big stake in. AV is coming, maybe not now, maybe not next year, but it is inevitably coming. And all these AV, especially the smaller ones, need a platform to operate their fleet. Do you build it from the ground up or join UBER who has 25 million rides a day already?

They are also partnered with BYD for the electrification of their fleet. Guess what is BYD also working on? Yeah, thats right, AVs. And judging BYD/China success on doing EVs, I think thats a pretty good chance they will also succeed on the AV side. And since they are already partenered, where do you think BYDs AV fleet will be used? In UBER.

I think the company is positioned greatly for the future, its profitable after multiple years of negative EPS, it has a clear plan moving forward about their free cash flow, including reducing $2B out of their debt by the end of the year.

**TL;DR** = Right now the market leaders in weight loss are $LLY and $NVO with injectable needles. $VKTX is also in this delivery mechanism, but showing better safety in their phase 2a data and got FDA approval to go straight to Phase 3 trails and skipping Phase 2b which is huge news.

**Oral Data Catalyst** \- Nobody likes taking weekly injectables, so an ""oral pill"" is seen as a gamechanger. Weight loss over 5% is a very competitive number and **over 6% will be home run**. This is a 28 day trial and not 13 weeks. Pay attention to **efficacy and safety of VK2735**.

**M&A Buyout** \- There are big pharma companies out there who are not in the weight loss space yet such as Merck $MRK and their **$25 billion drug Keytruda going off patent in 2028**. $MRK needs to shore up a big revenue source soon and the **wight loss drug category is poised to reach $471 Billion by 2032.**

**$LLY** Orforglipron showed 3% weight loss, \~ 28% vomiting. 39% Nausea

**$NVO** two oral drugs

1. Monlunabant- I personally don't see a path for this drug. 3.3% weight loss in 28 days but here comes the safety hammer with drug showing psychiatric issues like anxiety, irritability, and sleep disturbances won't go well with FDA. $SNY drug rimonabant (never got approved) because drug was plagued with CNS issues
2. Amycretin- Weight loss around 4% (don't have the exact number) but safety profile is as worse as CT-996. Nause 75%, Vomiting 56%, diarrhea 18.8%.

**Conclusion:** For $VKTX the bar is to show weight loss 5-6% or higher to beat competitors and stay competitive with tolerability profile.

AIP sets Palantir apart from the rest of the SaaS universe, driving visible AI-related growth and acceleration in multiple different metrics – at this time, other leading AI favorites such as Snowflake or MongoDB can’t say the same. Outside of the cloud hyperscalers, Palantir is one of the rare few that sees AI drive both real returns for its business and real value for its customers due to AIP.

AIP has driven tremendous growth for Palantir’s business since its release, with primary impacts arising in the commercial segment. A clear inflection point in Palantir’s growth is visible following AIP’s release, while other ‘AI’ cloud peers can’t say the same about AI-driven growth.

Capcom might benefit hugely from its next release,1gg9pmw,grailly,2024-10-31 14:01:02,12,0.69,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gg9pmw/capcom_might_benefit_hugely_from_its_next_release/,"*Disclaimer: Capcom is my biggest position and has been for a while. I am a Monster Hunter fan. I usually just write about video games and have little financial insight. My video game insight might be useful, though.*

Capcom is a Japanese video game company that has been doing quite well lately. You might know them for games such as Resident Evil, Street Fighter, Mega Man and Monster Hunter. That last series is the reason I'm writing this up.

Capcom just released its financial results for the first half of the year and they don't look too great. This was 100% expected as their new releases were thin, but the stock price is still down. However, the next entry to Monster Hunter, Monster Hunter Wilds (MHWi), is coming in February and I don't think it is properly priced in.

Monster Hunter is secretly huge. People into video games know about it and know it is big of course, but I feel they don't exactly appreciate how big. Monster Hunter World (MHWo) (the ""prequel"" to Wilds) sold 27 million units, those are Call of Duty numbers. You can bring that to 41million units if you count the full price expansion that followed a year later. Capcom still sold 3million+ units of MHWo (base game + expansion) in FY24. As of writing this, MHWo is the 23rd most played game on Steam, that is above games such as Elden Ring and Destiny 2 which both had big expansions this very year. It 's barely below Baldur's Gate 3, which released last year. MHWo came out in 2018 (2019 for the expansion).

MHWi will be the first Monster Hunter game to release on Steam on the same day as consoles, I believe this will generate surprisingly huge numbers. These numbers are made public on Steam and help generate a ton of hype. Media outlets just adore writing about player numbers. I fully believe MHWi will have a hype cycle similar to Helldivers 2 or Palworld this year, maybe not quite as strong as Wukong, though. This will establish Monster Hunter as a big mainstream franchise.

As opposed to Helldivers, Palworld or Wukong, there's actually a stock to go and buy during the hype cycle. I'm betting on people throwing money at Capcom.

**Why write this now?**

As I said, the stock is down, so there's a nice little window here. It might go down further before February, though.

There's a beta for MHWi going on right now. I played the game, it's a little bit rough, but I can at least attest that there are no major issues. Reception has been pretty good.

The beta was on PS5 until now and it opens to Steam and Xbox later today, we will have a first glimpse at the Steam numbers. I wanted to write this before we know those numbers in case in unexpectedly blows up. The beta is quite limited, so most players won't spend hours and hours on it, which limits player counts. I don't think it'll blow up, but there a small chance it breaks top 10 on Steam. Any more than that and MHWi is a guaranteed mega-hit.

**Risks:**

Gaming communities have become quite finicky and can turn on games in a dime. We saw this earlier this year with Dragon's Dogma 2 also from Capcom. It suffered a lot of bad press because of bad graphics performance, dumb DLC and some misunderstanding. It still sold rather well, but it could have done much more, in my opinion.

MHWi *will* have questionable performance (not as bad as DD2 and it won't be a bad surprise because we can run it ourselves in the beta) and it *will* have some dumb DLC. Now it's a matter of seeing if gaming communities decide to latch on to it or not.

**Bonus:**

Capcom also makes Resident Evil games which have been very popular. There might be an announcement of the next one rather soon, which might have an effect on the stock price.

**TLDR;**

Monster Hunter Wilds is releasing on February 28th:

1. It will be selling more than expected
2. The hype will propulse the stock even higher

Dropbox - The outsider with a sticky product,1gg24n1,k_ristovski,2024-10-31 06:10:47,6,0.64,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gg24n1/dropbox_the_outsider_with_a_sticky_product/,"**1.0 Introduction**

Back in 2017, two MIT students (Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi) secured funding from seed accelerator Y Combinator, for what would become Dropbox, one of the first companies to offer **cloud storage and file syncing**.

It had a first-mover advantage, that combined with a simple user-friendly interface, and a freemium model, allowed the company to grow from **1 million** registered users back in April 2009, to over **700 million** in 2021. Although this sounds impressive, I’ll argue this is *a pointless metric*, but I’ll get back to that.

The freemium model attracted many users to test out their product and access a limited amount of storage for free. If they need more storage, then they can opt for various paid plans (Dropbox Plus, Dropbox Business).



**2.0 An incredibly sticky product**

A crucial property to take into account is the **stickiness** of the product**.**

***The perceived risk and effort involved in transferring large volumes of data often outweigh the potential savings of switching services.***

Cloud storage platforms hold critical, often irreplaceable, data that users depend on for continuity and productivity. The migration process can seem risky—not just for the potential of data loss or corruption, but also for the disruption it could cause to established workflows and collaborative setups.

Moreover, the time cost of planning, executing, and verifying a migration is significant for larger organizations.

***Even if a competitor offers a cheaper option, the combined weight of time, complexity, and the fear of potential issues can make the cost savings feel secondary.***

For many users, the existing service might offer just enough value or reliability to make the switch feel unnecessary, reinforcing Dropbox's and similar platforms' stickiness.



**3.0 The pointless metric & what actually matters.**

It is not unusual for companies to have some sort of storytelling element in their disclosures, press releases, or earnings reports. The purpose of these elements is nothing else but to create excitement, even if it is pointless.

You’ll notice, Dropbox chose **registered**, instead of **active**. Given that their base model is free, once someone becomes a user, that person remains a user **forever!** So the number of registered users will always go up.

However, if we take a look at the paid subscribers, historically, that is **\~2.5%** of the registered users. **So, 97.5% of all registered users are freeloaders** ***(including myself)*** **and add no value to the company.**

Don’t get me wrong, having over 18 million paid subscribers is impressive. It is important to focus on this number and acknowledge that the growth days are behind.

The competition is fierce, ranging from Google and Amazon to Microsoft and Apple. What surprised me was that during the pandemic, there was ***no growth acceleration.***



**4.0 The past acquisitions**

The company has engaged in numerous acquisitions:

* **July 2012, TapEngage** \- *a startup that enables advertisers and publishers to collaborate on tablet-optimized advertising.*
* **December 2012, Audiogalaxy** \- *a startup allowing users to store their music files and playlists in the cloud and then stream them to any device.*
* **December 2012, Snapjoy** \- *a company allowing users to ""aggregate, archive and view all of their digital photos from their cameras, phones and popular apps.*
* **July 2013, Endorse** \- *a mobile coupon startup.*
* **April 2014, Loom** \- *a photo-sharing company which would be shut down and integrated with the then-recently announced Carouse*
* **April 2014, Hackpad** \- *a document-sharing startup*
* **May 2014, Bubbli -** *a startup that has built some innovative ways of incorporating 3D technology into 2D views, and packaging it in a mobile app.*
* **January 2015, CloudOn** \- *a company that provided mobile applications for document editing and creation.*
* **January 2019, HelloSign** \- *e-signature company* ***(largest acquisition $230m).***
* **March 2021, DocSend** \- *secure document sharing and analytics product.*
* **October 2021, Command E** \- universal search company
* **November 2022, Boxcryptor** \- *end-to-end zero-knowledge encryption for cloud storage services*
* **December 2022, FormSwift** \- *form management platform*



There have been many studies that acquisitions (on average) tend to destroy shareholders’ value. If you agree with that, then Dropbox should be avoided like the plague given their past activity.



**5.0 The financials**

If you look at the financials, this is impressive, especially given the fact that they’re competing with Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.

The revenue grew from $845m back in 2016 to $2.5 billion in the last twelve months.

The operating margin improved from **-23%** (-$194m) to **+26%** ($670m).

A lot of focus (especially from the management) goes to FCF and there’s a reason for that. Every company that has high stock-based compensation would like to focus on the free cash flow, as SBC is a non-cash expense.

From 2018 (when the company became public) until H1-2024, the company generated **$3.9 billion** in free cash flow. This might sound impressive, given its market cap is $8.5 billion, however, it incurred **$2.3 billion** in stock-based compensation.

So, where did the $3.9 billion go to? **Share buybacks.** The number of shares outstanding is down \~20% since becoming a public company.

Based on their capital allocation over the last 5 years, it seems as if their capital allocation strategy has changed from **acquiring more companies** to **returning capital to the shareholders via buybacks**.

  
**6.0 The valuation**

How does one value a company of this kind?

It has a sticky product that generates relatively stable cash flow that is returned to the shareholders via buybacks. I’ll argue that it has a lot of similarities with a bond and a **dividend discount model** is an appropriate model to value a company of this kind.

Except, instead of using the dividend, I’ll use **free cash flow** **- SBC.**

Inputs:

Free cash flow - SBC of $450m.

Growth in perpetuity of 4%.

Discount rate of 8%.

Adjusting for cash/debt

The value of the company is $8.8 billion ($27/share), which isn't that far off from today's share price of $26/share.

  
**7.0 My thoughts**

A company with a sticky product that has stable financial performance is expected to be less volatile than the average company out there. This is indeed the case, and the stock price beta is 0.6. Beta is a measure of risk that compares the volatility of the share price vs. an index (in this case, the S&P500). However, low risk goes hand in hand with low return. Therefore, expecting \~8% long-term yield seems fair.

I don’t find this an attractive opportunity, at this price point. However, *if the share price decreases to $20*, then the answer would be different.

The only scenario where I see a significant upside is if Dropbox is being acquired by a giant, such as Salesforce.

The company is in a ""transitional period"" as its file sync and share business and its Dash artificial-intelligence search feature mature, Houston wrote.

""Navigating this transition while maintaining our current structure and investment levels is no longer sustainable,"" he said in his note.

The move follows a 16% cut to Dropbox's workforce in April 2023, which affected 500 staffers. At the time, Houston wrote that the cuts were due to slowing growth, economic headwinds and the need to invest more resources and head count into the increasingly competitive AI race.

Dropbox will be making cuts to the parts of its business where the company is ""over-invested or underperforming"" while working toward a ""flatter, more efficient"" team structure, Houston wrote.

""We continue to see softening demand and macro headwinds in our core business,"" Houston wrote. ""But external factors are only part of the story. We've heard from many of you that our organizational structure has become overly complex, with excess layers of management slowing us down.""

Affected employees will receive 16 weeks of pay, starting Wednesday, with one additional week of pay for each completed tenure year at the company.

The company previously released a preliminary report of its quarterly results on Oct. 22 and announced it was suspending its fiscal 2025 outlook. 

This report marks the first under CEO Brian Niccol, who joined the company on Sept. 9 to revive the floundering business. 

“It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers,” CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement. “We have a clear plan and are moving quickly to return Starbucks to growth.”

Investors are expecting that Niccol will share more details about his turnaround strategy during the company’s conference call, scheduled for 5 p.m. ET.

Shares of the company fell 1% in extended trading on Wednesday.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 80 cents vs. $1.03 expected

Revenue: $9.07 billion vs. $9.36 billion expected

Starbucks reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income attributable to the company of $909.3 million, or 80 cents per share, down from $1.22 billion, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier.

Net sales dropped 3% to $9.07 billion. 

The company’s global same-store sales fell 7%, fueled by weak demand in the U.S. and China. Traffic to its stores worldwide fell 8% during the quarter.

The company’s U.S. restaurants reported same-store sales declines of 6%, fueled by a 10% tumble in traffic.

In China, the company’s same-store sales plummeted 14% as both traffic and average ticket fell. Starbucks has been facing greater competition from local rivals, like Luckin Coffee, which can undercut the company’s prices.

"Visa plans to fire 1,400 employees and contractors",1gfso4m,Puginator,2024-10-30 23:20:37,132,0.92,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gfso4m/visa_plans_to_fire_1400_employees_and_contractors/,"Multinational payment card services corporation Visa has been planning to lay off nearly 1,400 employees and contractors by the end of 2024. 

According to sources familiar with the matter, Visa intends to fire around 1,400 employees and contractors to advance its strategy to simplify its international business. Initially reported by the Wall Street Journal, the announcement stated that approximately 1,000 of the cuts are projected to remove technology positions, with the majority of the layoffs being focused on Visa’s merchant sales and global digital partnership roles.

The report mentions that a part of the layoffs ensued a week before the news dropped, with Visa encouraging individuals to apply for open positions. However, Visa intends to maintain its workers in the global digital partnership teams employed in their positions through the end of 2024. According to a Visa representative cited by Reuters, the company works towards evolving its operational model to advance its growth, which can in turn lead to the elimination of some roles currently present. Despite this, Visa plans to employ more individuals each year for the foreseeable future, depending on its needs and demands.

Visa’s legal issues

Recently, Visa has been facing legal issues and was under scrutiny from regulators, as well as dissatisfied merchants. For example, in September 2024, The US Justice Department sued Visa for monopolising the debit card market, charging significant fees, and inhibiting competition. The civil antitrust lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, charged the company with violating sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act due to more than 60% of debit transactions in the US running on its debit network.

Moreover, Visa was alleged to unlawfully amassed the capability to extract fees that exceeded what it could charge in a competitive market. At the same time, merchants and banks transferred those funds to consumers by scaling prices or by minimising the quality of services. This led to Visa’s conduct negatively impacting the price of everything. The lawsuit was filed to reinstate competition in the market and to support the US public.

Why SMCI's situation is a massive threat to Nvidia,1gfqlq2,skilliard7,2024-10-30 21:54:39,5,0.53,92,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gfqlq2/why_smcis_situation_is_a_massive_threat_to_nvidia/,"SMCI has faced allegations of accounting manipulation, which have escalated this morning when it was revealed that their auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The true extent of the situation is not yet known to the public

SMCI is one of Nvidia's largest customers, accounting for 9% of their sales. If they go under, Nvidia will take a massive hit to their future earnings.

Some may argue that it does not matter, because since Nvidia's production is sold out, any gap in orders would be filled by other customers. There are 2 problems with this assumption:

1. This ignores the impact of a hypothetical liquidation of SMCI. If SMCI was faking orders, this would mean that they likely have a growing inventory of AI chips. These would then be auctioned off, creating a surge in supply, competing with new orders.

2. The duration of Nvidia's lead times can impact their margins and pricing power. If you have a 12 month lead time due to immense demand, you can hike prices. If that lead time shrinks to 1 month due to losing a significant customer, you have less margin to raise prices without impacting sales.

This scandal could also draw attention to other ""round tripping"" arrangements in the tech industry, in which circular transactions are set up in order to fake revenue growth. This could very much be the start of the unraveling of a bubble.

This isn't going to bankrupt Nvidia, they still have incredibly successful products and other customers, but it could definitely lead to a case where earnings growth stagnates, or is not sufficient enough to justify their current share price.

Despite this tremendous threat, Nvidia is down just 1% today, which is well within its normal volatility. The market is not responding to this new information appropriately.",2024-10-30,0.9244,Positive,"['SMCI', 'SMCI', 'SMCI', 'SMCI', 'AI']"

Who wins btwn NVO vs LLY in the Weightloss Market,1gfpzws,YungPersian,2024-10-30 21:29:36,16,0.81,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gfpzws/who_wins_btwn_nvo_vs_lly_in_the_weightloss_market/,"Because of what I’ll talk about below I don’t include things like ALT or Viking therapeutics. In the long term their best plays feel like they lean more towards acquisition. 

It feels like we’re getting too bogged down on which drug performs marginally better when we look at weight loss drugs. It feels irrelevant to the fundamental assumptions baked into growth forecasts which is that there would be a wider adoption of the treatment. 

At the end of the day the semantics of x% weight loss on drug A vs y% on drug B only matter so much. I think what is really going to decide who wins this competition and who grows their market share is whoever is able to more materially lower their prices.

As income decreases obesity rates increase. As an example only 29% of women with incomes 350% above the poverty level are obese vs 42% of those that are 130% below the poverty level. There’s also a much broader market if you were to include a lower income groups. So having less access to more expensive and healthier foods means higher rates of obesity, this makes sense.

Frankly, I don’t think people in lower income groups care about which one is marginally better, they want something they can afford. And both NVO and LLY have such massive barriers to broadening their market because of their exorbitant pricing. There is a clear disconnect between variables that might increase the rate of someone having the ailment these companies want to treat, and the prices they sell these treatments for.

Wanted to wait until LLYs earnings came out today to see if this is an industry trend or not. And what I described above feels like it ties to what we’re seeing performance wise. Both LLY in its earnings today and NVO last quarter (and likely this quarter) had more substantial sales misses and changes to forward looking forecasts. 

To me this feel less like Competitor A selling more than Competitor B and moreso an industry wide forecast miss. And this forecast miss is because they assumed the market would grow more substantially by now, but I think they’re hitting a point where growth is slowing because the LARGER bucket of their addressable market really can’t afford their treatments at their current prices. 

So in the long run for a drug that treats ailments such as Ozempic or Zepbound it feels like this will be less of a race over which drug performs better and more towards which drug people can actually afford. As a result I think both NVO and LLY will decline in share price and performance until they figure this out. What’s everyone else’s thoughts?

And frankly, it's still day one.
* We continue to see a strong pipeline of potential partners that are striving to modernize their platforms.
* Our one-stop shop continues to attract great cross-buying behavior by our members. In fact, 32% of new products were opened by existing SoFi members and 20% of our new members opened a second product in their first 30 days. This is the power of the flywheel we have developed.
* Overall, we're making incredible progress in our shift towards more fee-based, capital-light and lower-risk revenue sources. Combined, fee-based revenue made up $174 million or a quarter of our adjusted net revenue in Q3. This revenue grew by 65% year-over-year. On an annualized basis, that's nearly $700 million in revenue.
* We've achieved 17 of 19 quarters of record revenue through a recession, a pandemic, 150 basis point rate drop, damage to our largest and most profitable business, student lender finance only to face a 500 basis point increase in rates and the collapse of venerable financial institutions in our neighborhood.
* Our performance in the hard times is what gives me the strong confidence in our future. Today, we faced fewer headwinds than any point in our history. We're heading into 2025 with the most favorable conditions of the last seven years with declining rates and a stable economy.
* We continue to establish SoFi as a trusted household name. We ended Q3 with our highest average unaided brand awareness of all time, up nearly 40% year-over-year to 7%. 
* We continue to innovate so people find unique value when they use our products. 
* We also launched our new directed share program, which offers a modern and streamlined approach to equity programs for companies looking to raise capital through IPOs.
* SoFi Plus, our premium membership tier and our beta testing a new fee-based subscription option in the coming months.
* In credit cards, we officially launched the everyday cash rewards and the essential credit cards, enabling SoFi to serve more people spending and borrowing needs,
* We shift towards even more fee-based, capital-light, and lower-risk sources of revenue.
* We also signed our first two direct insurance carriers for SoFi Protect, complementing our comprehensive financial services offering we've built over the last five years.
* Home refinancing volume was the highest we've seen since the second quarter of 2022.
* In our tech platform, we signed several new partnerships, including processing deals with two charter banks in Mexico and a deployment of Galileo's Cyber Bancorp for SoFi's new commercial payment services sponsored bank program.
* We launched additional fraud prevention solutions, the Galileo instant verification engine, which we call GIVE as well as transaction risk GScore, both of which help clients enhance their security and operational efficiency. Our new secured credit with dynamic funding offering promotes greater financial inclusion and enables clients to help their customers build stronger credit.
* We launched programs with clients signed in prior quarters, spanning cross-border payments, global payouts, financial literacy, and scalable payment solutions.
* Delinquencies peaked in March of 2024. Since then, we've continued to see improvements quarter-over-quarter.
* In closing, I couldn't be more proud of what we've accomplished not just for Q3, but for delivering a steady and consistent record of durable growth, incredible brand building and product innovation that help our members and clients and strong improving returns for our shareholders.

Thank you, everyone, for your time today, and we hope you have a great end to 2024.

CFO:

* Loan Platform Deals: CFO: This is a fee-based and capital-light revenue source for us. We generate cash fees upfront at the time of transfer or referral without taking balance sheet risk. Importantly, there are no financing commitments or loss share agreements associated with these deals.
* There is a 220 basis points difference between the interest we pay on deposits and the interest we pay on warehouse lines, which translates to more than $500 million in annualized interest expense savings given the size of our deposit base.
* We expect modest growth in balance sheet originations year-over-year. We are happy with the current size of our balance sheet and the net interest income generated. Excess demand from borrowers and loan investors is being fulfilled through our loan platform business. We expect growth in student loan refinancing and home loans in a lower rate environment.
* Recent (loan) vintages are projected to produce higher returns, with ROEs above 30%. This is driven by lower expected life of loan loss rates, higher pricing beta, funding cost efficiencies, and origination fees.
* We expect continued strong growth in the loan platform business, with commitments from Fortress and other partners. Demand is strong, and we are fulfilling it through the loan platform business.
* For the full year 2024, we now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $2.535 billion to $2.550 billion, which is $85 million higher than our prior guidance range of $2.425 billion to $2.465 billion. This implies 22% to 23% annual growth versus 17% to 19% previously. This guidance assumes lending revenue will be at least 100% of 2023 levels.
* Financial Services will grow more than 80% year-over-year and tech platform will grow low to upper teens percent year-over-year.
* GAAP EPS of $0.11 to $0.12 per share above prior guidance of $0.09 to $0.10 per share.

Volkswagen profit plunges 42% in third quarter amid sweeping overhaul plans,1gfm8o3,Puginator,2024-10-30 18:45:05,184,0.98,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gfm8o3/volkswagen_profit_plunges_42_in_third_quarter/,"German automaker Volkswagen on Wednesday reported a 42% drop in operating profit in the third quarter.

Operating profit fell to 2.86 billion euros ($3.1 billion), while third quarter sales revenues slipped 0.5% year on year to around 78.5 billion euros.

Vehicle sales fell 8.3% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same time period a year earlier, Volkswagen said.

Net liquidity across the Volkswagen Group stood at negative 160.6 billion euros at the end of September 2024, it said. The company’s net liquidity stood at negative 147.4 billion euros at the end of 2023.

Volkswagen on Wednesday said that its results across the first three quarters of the year were impacted by higher fixed costs and restructuring efforts. Operating profit between January and September of this year was 21% lower on an annual basis.

Volkswagen shares were were last 1.8% higher at 8:19 a.m. London time.

Arno Antlitz, chief financial officer and chief operating officer at Volkswagen Group, said the performance reflected a “challenging market environment” and highlighted the importance of ongoing performance programs across the company.

The third quarter results come after Volkswagen last month cut its 2024 annual outlook for the second time in just a few months. At the time, the car maker said it was expecting a profit margin of around 5.6% for the year, along with a 0.7% drop in sales to 320 billion euros. Those figures were left unchanged on Wednesday.

Volkswagen has been in hot water in recent months, warning of potential plant closures in Germany and scrapping a slew of labor agreements with local workers in September. The company also said it would end its employment protection agreement, which has been in place for its German workforce since 1994.

On Monday, the Volkswagen works council said the company’s management was planning widespread pay cuts and layoffs, as well as the closure or size reduction of all of its German plants.

In response, Volkswagen reiterated the need for restructuring and said that it would present plans for work cost cuts during a round of negotiations about the labor agreements, which is also taking place on Wednesday.

“Ahead of the negotiations today, we need to state: the situation is getting more serious,” Volkswagen’s chief negotiator Arne Meiswinkel said on Wednesday according to a CNBC translation.

He added that current developments in the auto industry in Europe and especially in Germany were concerning, as shown by the latest figures from both the company and its competitors.

Meiswinkel reiterated that Volkswagen needed to lower costs and increase its efficiency to be in a position that allows it to invest in its future.

*On October 24, 2024, Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) sent the members of the Audit Committee a letter of resignation as the Company’s registered public accounting firm (the “Resignation Letter”).*  
  
*The Chair of the Audit Committee discussed with EY the reasons for EY’s resignation. The Company has begun the process of identifying a successor independent registered public accounting firm. The Company will authorize EY to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor independent registered public accounting firm, once selected. The Company does not currently expect that resolution of any of the matters raised by EY, or under consideration by the Special Committee, as noted below, will result in any restatements of its quarterly reports for the fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, or for prior fiscal years.*  
  
*EY was engaged on March 15, 2023 to perform an audit for the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, and has not issued any report on the Company’s financial statements or the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. EY resigned while conducting the audit for the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, EY’s first audit on the Company’s behalf.*  
  
*In late July 2024, EY communicated to the Audit Committee concerns about several matters relating to governance, transparency and completeness of communications to EY, and other matters pertaining to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and that the timely filing of the Company’s annual report was at significant risk. In response, the Board appointed an independent special committee of the Board (the “Special Committee”) to review the matters and certain of the Company’s internal controls and certain governance procedures (the “Review”). The Special Committee engaged Cooley LLP, and forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors, LLC to perform an investigation on behalf of and at the direction of the Special Committee. EY and the Board received updates with preliminary information relating to the Review. As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Review remains ongoing and final findings and recommendations have not yet been communicated to EY or the Board.*

In the Resignation Letter, EY stated, in part: “we are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.”*  
  
*Although the Company recognizes EY’s decision is final, it disagrees with EY’s decision to resign as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm – the Special Committee has not yet obtained all information relevant for the Review and has not concluded the Review.

Apparently that's a $20decillion, fine.

  
Google banned the ultra-nationalist Tsargrad channel from YouTube in 2020, in response to US sanctions imposed against its owner, but after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 more channels were added to the banned list. 

The court imposed a 100,000 rubles per day, equivalent to about $1,025, with the total fine doubling every week. Thanks to the compound interest Google has now racked up a fine which the Russian judge on Monday called ‘a case in which there are many, many zeroes’. There are so many zeroes, in fact that the total fine amount completely dwarfs global GDP, which the World Bank estimates at about $100trillion.

In its most recent earnings statement, it said: ‘We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. ‘For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.

The U.S. economy expanded at a healthy pace during the third quarter, keeping fears of a downturn at bay while Federal Reserve officials eye further interest-rate cuts.

Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% over the three months ended in September, according to the first estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The consensus call among economists surveyed by FactSet was for growth of 2.6% in the third quarter, though Bloomberg's forecast was for 2.9%.  

Wednesday's solid third-quarter growth comes after real GDP growth was 3% during the second quarter and 1.6% during the first three months of the year.

While GDP is a fundamental economic measure, most economists and analysts believe Federal Reserve officials will use inflation and employment data as more of a guide when weighing their interest-rate policy decision at next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

In other instances we hear assets are dropping because the liquidity cycle just peaked. 

What is this liquidity we are talking about here and where does it all come from? Clearly there are many sources, but who are the main ones and how do they operate? 

The easiest one to point to is the Federal Reserve and its many QE (quantitative easing) programs. However, liquidity often rises even when the FED is running QT (quantitative tightening) as was the case in 2023.

Many point to the treasury as the hidden source of liquidity conducting a stealth QE of sort, but how do they do that? How do they manage to inject money into the stock market? 

Its clear they can do that directly to the economy by handing out stimulus checks and paying for new government projects, but that does not directly go to the market.

Eli Lilly stock tumbles 10% after missing estimates and slashing profit guidance,1gfjvkg,thelastsubject123,2024-10-30 16:34:38,123,0.94,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gfjvkg/eli_lilly_stock_tumbles_10_after_missing/,"Eli Lilly on Wednesday fell short of profit and revenue expectations for the third quarter and slashed its full-year adjusted profit guidance, sending its stock tumbling roughly 10%.

The drugmaker now expects full-year adjusted earnings of between $13.02 to $13.52 per share, down from previous guidance of $16.10 to $16.60 per share. 

Eli Lilly also lowered the high-end of its revenue outlook for the year and now expects sales of between $45.4 billion and $46 billion. The company’s previous guidance called for revenue of as much as $46.6 billion.

Here’s what Eli Lilly reported for the period ended September 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: 

* **Earnings per share:** $1.18 adjusted vs. $1.47 expected
* **Revenue:** $11.44 billion vs. $12.11 billion expected

Demand in the U.S. has far outpaced supply for Lilly’s incretin drugs, such as Zepbound and Mounjaro, over the last year. Both treatments mimic certain gut hormones to tamp down a person’s appetite and regulate their blood sugar.

The popularity of those injectable drugs has forced both Eli Lilly and its main rival, Novo Nordisk, to invest billions to increase manufacturing capacity for the treatments.

Eli Lilly’s supply woes began to ease earlier this year. As of Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration’s drug database said all doses of Zepbound and Mounjaro are available in the U.S. after extended shortages. Still, the agency warns that patients may not always be able to immediately fill their prescription for those drugs at a particular pharmacy.",2024-10-30,0.8625,Positive,['LSEG']

So pfizer reported their earnings yesterday and excluding covid products, their revenues grew in lower double digits. They haven't quantitatively addressed their upcoming patent cliffs and how they expect to offset those with new products.

Googling revealed that pharmas generally lose about 40-90% of their product revenues in the 1st year itself post patent expiration. I did some rough calculation and considering about 3 billion coming in from oncology products, growing at about 35% yoy, they will only cover about much less than 50% of the revenue losses due to patent expiration from 2026 onwards.

I'm not sure how accurate my numbers are but I reduced the revenue contribution of expiring patents by 40% yoy for 2026, 27, 28 and oncology contributions simply can't catch up. I know they have other products in pipeline, including oral GLP but I'm not sure how to account for that.

Can someone point me to more reading material on analysis or their analysis?

The company's shares rose 2% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

The global payments technology company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.71 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, beating the analyst consensus of $2.58. Revenue for the quarter came in at $9.6 billion, exceeding the expected $9.49 billion and representing a 12% increase YoY on both a nominal and constant-dollar basis.

Visa's strong performance was underpinned by stable growth in key metrics. Payments volume for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 8% YoY on a constant-dollar basis. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, rose 13% on a constant-dollar basis. Total processed transactions reached 61.5 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year.

Ryan McInerney, Chief Executive Officer of Visa, commented on the results: ""Visa had a robust fourth quarter to finish a very strong fiscal year. In the fourth quarter, net revenue and GAAP EPS grew by 12% and 17%, respectively, driven by relatively stable growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions plus strong momentum across new flows and value added services.""

Prediction: Apple is grossly priced compared to Microsoft,1gf523l,StrangeRemark,2024-10-30 02:17:24,350,0.82,175,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gf523l/prediction_apple_is_grossly_priced_compared_to/,"Congrats to those that followed my last Costco post. I don’t believe anyone can really predict the ups and downs of the market, and with the current market climbing past ATH’s, the safest bets are going to be balanced long-short positions in specific equities or spread bets. 

**Apple**

* Market cap: 3.6T
* Current P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 28.6
* Historical revenue growth: Flat to single digits
* Earnings growth: Low double digits
* Net Margin: 25%

 **Microsoft**

* Market cap: 3.2T
* Microsoft P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 32.8
* Historical revenue growth: 15%
* Earnings growth: 15-20%
* Net margin: 35%

Last week, Apple had a higher P/E than MSFT, before this narrowed in the last few days Relative to Microsoft. Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a ""potential supercycle"" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.

In my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.

To me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.

Here’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft & Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!

Tl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft

P.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is. A balanced long-short position doesn't mean I believe Apple will go down on nominal terms, just that it will go down relative to Microsoft. Using options or a long-short position is the way to extract value when you see the spread in two equities increase.  ",2024-10-30,0.9862,Positive,"['ATH', 'MSFT', 'MSFT']"

Here is how the company did:

* **Earnings per share:** 8 cents adjusted vs. 5 cents expected, according to LSEG
* **Revenue:** $1.37 billion vs. $1.36 billion expected, according to LSEG 
* **Global daily active users:** 443 million vs. 441 million expected, according to StreetAccount
* **Global average revenue per user:** $3.10 vs. $3.09 expected, according to StreetAccount

Snap said fourth-quarter sales will be between $1.51 billion and $1.56 billion. The midpoint of its guidance is $1.54 billion, which is below the average analyst estimate of $1.56 billion.

Snap said its adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter will be between $210 million and $260 million. The middle of the range is higher than analysts’ estimates of $230.7 million.

The company’s sales jumped 15% year over year in the third quarter while its net loss narrowed by 58% year over year in the third quarter to $153 million, compared to a net loss of $368 million a year prior.

The number of Snapchat+ paying subscribers is now at 12 million, the company said. That is up from the 11 million it reported in August. The company debuted its subscription service in 2022, pitching it as a way for users to experience exclusive and prerelease features for $3.99 a month.

Snap also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program on Tuesday.

“Our investments in AI and AR are powering new creative experiences for our community and driving innovation across our advertising platform, underpinning our long term growth opportunity,” Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in a statement.

In September, Snap debuted the fifth generation of its Spectacles augmented reality glasses that people can wear to see digital imagery spliced into the physical world. The new Spectacles are only available to developers who must pay $99 a month for one year if they want to build AR apps for the glasses.

Shortly after Snap announced the new Spectacles, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed the social networking giant’s experimental AR glasses called Orion. Meta’s Orion AR glasses have generated enthusiasm from employees and the company plans to attract developers next year in prelude for an eventual consumer launch.

In a letter to investors, Snap discussed the importance that developers play for the company’s Spectacles and AR initiatives.

“We aspire to be the most developer-friendly platform in the world, and we are excited to offer our new generation of Spectacles to developers as an invitation and inspiration to create new experiences,” Snap said in the letter.

Here’s how the company did compared to LSEG estimates:

* **Earnings per share:** 16 cents vs. a loss of 7 cents
* **Revenue:** $348.4 million vs. $312.8 million expected

Reddit said fourth-quarter revenue will be between $385 million to $400 million, beating the average analyst estimate of $357.9 million. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter will be in the range of $110 million to $125 million, higher than the $85.2 million average estimate.

Revenue in the third quarter jumped 68% from a year earlier, and the company turned profitable, reporting net income of $29.9 million, compared to a net loss of $7.4 million during the same quarter a year ago.

The company said that its daily active users grew 47% year-over-year in the third quarter to 97.2 million, better than analyst estimates of 96.5 million.

Average revenue per user was $3.58 for the third quarter, which beat analyst estimates of $3.24.

“It was another strong quarter for Reddit and our communities as we achieved important milestones, including new levels of user traffic, revenue growth, and profitability,” Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said in a statement. “Reddit continues to be one of the most visited and trusted sites in the world with opportunities available to us that aren’t available to most companies.”

This is Reddit’s third earnings report since going public in March. The stock has more than doubled in value since its IPO, closing on Tuesday at $81.74, giving the company a market cap of $13.6 billion.

Since last year, Reddit has benefited from Google search updates that helped push its content higher in results, bringing in a flood of new users to the 19-year-old social media service. However, the newer users, which Reddit refers to as logged-out users, generate less online advertising revenue for the company than logged-in users, who typically spend more time on the platform, Reddit has detailed in financial filings.

The company said that global logged-out users grew 70% from a year earlier to 53.1 million, while global logged-in users increased 27% to 44.1 million.

Chipotle misses revenue estimates as same-store sales growth disappoints,1gf48om,Puginator,2024-10-30 01:43:00,105,0.97,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gf48om/chipotle_misses_revenue_estimates_as_samestore/,"Chipotle Mexican Grill on Tuesday reported mixed quarterly results, despite another quarter of higher traffic to its restaurants. 

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 27 cents adjusted vs. 25 cents expected

Revenue: $2.79 billion vs. $2.82 billion expected

Chipotle reported third-quarter net income of $378.4 million, or 28 cents per share, up from $313.2 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier. 

The company’s food and beverage costs increased during the quarter, in part due to Chipotle’s decision to re-emphasize generous portions after social media-fueled backlash over the size of its burrito bowls this summer.

Excluding items, the company earned 27 cents per share.

Net sales climbed 13% to $2.79 billion. 

Same-store sales rose 6%, just shy of StreetAccount estimates of 6.3%. Traffic to restaurants increased 3.3% in the quarter, continuing the chain’s streak of bucking an overall slump in foot traffic across the industry. While many consumers have opted to eat out less, Chipotle has benefitted from having a wealthier customer base that’s willing to pay more for its burritos and bowls. 

During the third quarter, Chipotle brought back its popular smoked brisket for a limited time. It’s currently the most expensive protein, topping even the chain’s steak and beef barbacoa options.

Digital sales accounted for 34% of the chain’s quarterly food and beverage revenue.

The company opened 86 new locations during the quarter, 73 of which included a “Chipotlane” dedicated to online order pickup.

For the full year, Chipotle reiterated its outlook that same-store sales will grow by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage. The company also anticipates that it will open between 285 and 315 new restaurants this year.

Looking to 2025, Chipotle plans to open between 315 and 345 new locations. More than 80% of those restaurants will include a Chipotlane.

The earnings report marks the company’s first since CEO Brian Niccol departed to lead Starbucks’ turnaround. Chipotle’s board has tapped COO Scott Boatwright as the company’s interim chief executive.

"Microsoft's GitHub goes beyond OpenAI, welcomes AI models from Anthropic, Google",1gf1bg5,Puginator,2024-10-29 23:42:21,85,0.96,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gf1bg5/microsofts_github_goes_beyond_openai_welcomes_ai/,"Microsoft has a very expensive and very public relationship with artificial intelligence startup OpenAI. But one of Microsoft’s most successful AI products, GitHub Copilot, is now going beyond OpenAI to give developers more choice in what models they want to use.

GitHub, which Microsoft acquired in 2018, said in a blog post on Tuesday that developers will be able to power the GitHub Copilot Chat feature with Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model or Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, as alternatives to OpenAI’s GPT-4o, if they choose.

“There is no one model to rule every scenario, and developers expect the agency to build with the models that work best for them,” GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke said in the post. “It is clear the next phase of AI code generation will not only be defined by multi-model functionality, but by multi-model choice. Today, we deliver just that.”

Microsoft introduced GitHub Copilot in 2021, offering source code suggestions to software developers. Copilot relies on models from OpenAI, which has received billions of dollars in funding from Microsoft and has exploded in popularity since releasing ChatGPT in late 2022.

OpenAI’s o1-preview and o1-mini, which are meant to reason over difficult problems, will also be available in the Copilot Chat on GitHub’s website and in the open-source Visual Studio Code text editor. They’re currently available in a public preview. Google’s model will be released in public preview in the next few weeks, a spokesperson said.

The arrival of the o1 models from OpenAI in September led GitHub to look at adding a dropdown menu for Copilot to provide more options, Dohmke said in an interview with CNBC last week. At that point, it felt like “the right time” to add models from Anthropic and Google, Dohmke said.

Developers will be able to see which model works best for a given programming language or employ the one that adheres to corporate requirements, he added.

Many other Microsoft products, including Teams and Windows, use OpenAI models. And Microsoft continues to provide computing power to OpenAI, which is now valued at $157 billion. But the relationship between the two companies has frayed in the past year, following the sudden ouster and reinstatement of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in November. The dramatic incident reportedly angered Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

In February, Microsoft announced a partnership with early-stage AI model developer Mistral. The following month, Microsoft said it was hiring former DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman and employees of his startup, Inflection, whose Pi assistant competed with OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT. Over the summer, Microsoft named OpenAI as a competitor in a regulatory filing.

In the past month, GitHub has collaborated with engineering teams from Anthropic and Google on the safety, security and scalability of their models, Dohmke said.

“We are planning on extending that list in the future but have no partnerships to announce at this point,” he said, adding that GitHub wouldn’t want to overwhelm developers with too many choices.

Also on Tuesday, GitHub announced that its Copilot will gain the ability to perform speedy automated reviews of code updates through a public preview.

And GitHub showed a technical preview of a feature named Spark that can compose app prototypes based on text input and refine the designs with a few clicks. Developers will be able to modify the underlying code for the prototypes. Those interested in trying Spark can join a waiting list.

Once they receive access, people using Spark will be able to choose between GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, a GitHub spokesperson said.

Apple announces new and smaller Mac Mini with first redesign since 2010,1gf1aat,Puginator,2024-10-29 23:41:02,82,0.85,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gf1aat/apple_announces_new_and_smaller_mac_mini_with/,"Apple announced on Tuesday new Mac Mini models, featuring the first major redesign since 2010 that makes the desktop computer significantly smaller.

Aside from a redesign that shrunk the case and reduced the computer’s volume in half, the main upgrade on these new computers is that they include Apple’s latest chip, either the M4, or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro.

The Mac Mini is Apple’s least-expensive Mac, starting at $599, and does not include a display, which is sold separately. When the product line was first introduced in 2008, it was marketed as a computer for people switching from Microsoft Windows who could simply plug their existing keyboard, mouse and monitor into their new silver box.

The Mac Mini is not one of Apple’s highest-volume computers in terms of sales, but it is an important slot in Apple’s lineup, especially for people who make apps for iPhones and other Apple platforms. Many iPhone developers like to run a Mac Mini as a personal development server for coordinating uploads and code.

One improvement in the new design is that all of the ports are USB-C ports, the same more modern offering found on Apple’s laptops. There are three USB-C ports on the rear and two on the front, a new addition that will make it easier to plug or unplug accessories while the computer rests on a desk.

Apple said in a press release that the M4 is a significant improvement over the M2 chip in the previous version released in 2022. Graphics and games are more than twice as fast, and the M4 can support up to 14 CPU cores and 20 GPU cores, an increase over the past generation. Apple first introduced the M4 in May in Apple’s iPad Pro.

Apple is framing the new Mac Minis, like all of its new products announced this year, as built for Apple Intelligence, the company’s artificial intelligence system released this week. Apple has said a forthcoming integration of ChatGPT into writing fields inside apps such as Word will allow users to generate and rewrite text and emails using the system.

However, unlike on the iPhone, where only phones released in the past two years will support Apple Intelligence, all of Apple’s computers with the M1 chip and newer since 2020 can run the company’s AI. 

Apple’s Mac family remains a large business segment even though it is less important to the company than the iPhone. In the June quarter, Apple reported $7 billion in Mac sales, up about 2% on an annual basis.

Apple’s chief marketer previously teased a “week of announcements.” The company unveiled new iMac computers on Monday, so it seems plausible more is coming. This week’s new Macs are likely Apple’s last major hardware announcements for the year.

McDonald's reverses U.S. same-store sales declines in Q3; E. coli fallout looms,1geu345,Puginator,2024-10-29 18:33:19,97,0.95,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1geu345/mcdonalds_reverses_us_samestore_sales_declines_in/,"McDonald’s on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts’ expectations as its U.S. restaurants reversed last quarter’s same-store sales decline.

However, investors are worried about another dent to U.S. sales fueled by a recent E. coli outbreak across 13 states linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounder burgers. As of Friday, 75 health cases have been tied to the outbreak, including one death of an older adult.

Health authorities have honed in on the burger’s slivered onions as the likely source, and McDonald’s has suspended its relationship with the supplier. Quarter Pounder burgers will return to affected restaurants on a rolling basis this week, sans slivered onions.

“While the situation appears to be contained, and though it didn’t affect Q3 numbers, it’s certainly an important development, which I know is on many of your minds,” CEO Chris Kempczinski told investors on the company’s earnings call, adding that McDonald’s was sorry and is committed to “making this right.”

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in premarket trading.

Here’s what the company reported for the period ended Sept. 30, compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $3.23 adjusted vs. $3.20 expected

Revenue: $6.87 billion vs. $6.82 billion expected

McDonald’s posted third-quarter net income of $2.26 billion, or $3.13 per share, down from $2.32 billion, or $3.17 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding certain items, the fast-food giant earned $3.23 per share.

Net sales rose 3% to $6.87 billion.

The chain’s global same-store sales fell 1.5%, a more drastic decline than the 0.6% that Wall Street was expecting, according to StreetAccount estimates, and was weighed down by the company’s international markets. It’s the second straight quarter that the company’s same-store sales have fallen.

“While we anticipated a challenging environment in 2024, our performance this year has fallen short of our expectations,” Kempczinski said.

U.S. same-store sales rose 0.3%, reversing last quarter’s same-store sales declines but still slightly weaker than the 0.5% increase predicted by StreetAccount estimates. Traffic to its U.S. restaurants was slightly negative, but the company credited its marketing and a $5 value meal launched in late June for the increase in sales.

Diners have pulled back their restaurant spending, leading McDonald’s and its rivals to lean into discounts and other marketing tricks to bring customers back to their restaurants. For example, in August, McDonald’s launched limited-time “Collector’s Edition” cups.

The company’s two international divisions both reported steeper declines in same-store sales compared with the prior quarter. The international operated markets segment, which includes France, Germany and Australia, saw same-store sales shrink 2.1%. The international developmental licensed markets division reported same-store sales declines of 3.5%, driven by weak demand in the Middle East and China.

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, it’s unclear how the E. coli outbreak might affect U.S. sales, particularly as consumers have grown more picky about how to spend their money and where.

McDonald’s executives have taken steps to reassure customers that the company’s menu items are safe to eat, including pulling Quarter Pounder burgers from menus in the affected areas until its beef patties were cleared as the culprit.

Still, foot traffic to U.S. locations fell roughly 10% in the three days immediately following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announcement last Tuesday of the E. coli outbreak tied to McDonald’s, according to a research note from Gordon Haskett Research Advisors.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

JPMorgan is suing customers accused of theft in viral 'infinite money glitch',1ge82cr,Puginator,2024-10-28 23:06:07,599,0.96,239,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ge82cr/jpmorgan_is_suing_customers_accused_of_theft_in/,"JPMorgan Chase has begun suing customers who allegedly stole thousands of dollars from ATMs by taking advantage of a technical glitch that allowed them to withdraw funds before a check bounced.

The bank on Monday filed lawsuits in at least three federal courts, taking aim at some of the people who withdrew the highest amounts in the so-called infinite money glitch that went viral on TikTok and other social media platforms in late August.

A Houston case involves a man who owes JPMorgan $290,939.47 after an unidentified accomplice deposited a counterfeit $335,000 check at an ATM, according to the bank.

“On August 29, 2024, a masked man deposited a check in Defendant’s Chase bank account in the amount of $335,000,” the bank said in the Texas filing. “After the check was deposited, Defendant began withdrawing the vast majority of the ill-gotten funds.”

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is investigating thousands of possible cases related to the “infinite money glitch,” though it hasn’t disclosed the scope of associated losses. Despite the waning use of paper checks as digital forms of payment gain popularity, they’re still a major avenue for fraud, resulting in $26.6 billion in losses globally last year, according to Nasdaq’s Global Financial Crime Report.

The infinite money glitch episode highlights the risk that social media can amplify vulnerabilities discovered at a financial institution. Videos began circulating in late August showing people celebrating the withdrawal of wads of cash from Chase ATMs shortly after bad checks were deposited.

Normally, banks only make available a fraction of the value of a check until it clears, which takes several days. JPMorgan says it closed the loophole a few days after it was discovered.

Miami and California

The other lawsuits filed Monday are in courts including Miami and the Central District of California, and involve cases where JPMorgan says customers owe the bank sums ranging from about $80,000 to $141,000.

Most cases being examined by the bank are for far smaller amounts, according to people with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified speaking about the internal investigation.

In each case, JPMorgan says its security team reached out to the alleged fraudster, but it hasn’t been repaid for the phony checks, in violation of the deposit agreement that customers sign when creating an account with the bank.

JPMorgan is seeking the return of the stolen funds with interest and overdraft fees, as well as lawyers’ fees and, in some cases, punitive damages, according to the complaints.

Criminal cases?

The lawsuits are likely to be just the start of a wave of litigation meant to force customers to repay their debts and signal broadly that the bank won’t tolerate fraud, according to the people familiar. JPMorgan prioritized cases with large dollar amounts and indications of possible ties to organized crime, they said.

The civil cases are separate from potential criminal investigations; JPMorgan says it has also referred cases to law enforcement officials across the country.

“Fraud is a crime that impacts everyone and undermines trust in the banking system,” JPMorgan spokesman Drew Pusateri said in a statement to CNBC. “We’re pursuing these cases and actively cooperating with law enforcement to make sure if someone is committing fraud against Chase and its customers, they’re held accountable.”

Much of that spending will go to NVIDIA and other AI-related device makers, with further increases expected in the coming quarters.
All signs point to continued strong AI-related spending. From chip device maker Asmax (ASML.US) to TSMC (TSM.US), AI has been a big part of this earnings season.
That backdrop has pushed NVIDIA shares higher, while Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang has assured that production of its new Blackwell chips is going well and demand is strong. NVIDIA is the biggest beneficiary of the big investment in artificial intelligence computing devices. The stock hit an all-time high last week and now has a market capitalization of about $3.5 trillion, slightly less than Apple (AAPL.US), which is still the world's most valuable company.
To be sure, there are concerns about the big tech companies' spending on artificial intelligence, as investors believe the billions of dollars these companies are investing are generating relatively little revenue. As such, this will be another focus of attention this week when these companies report earnings.
You have to walk the fine line of investing,“ said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at Themes ETFs, ‘so that investors understand that you're ’not going too far”.
Nvidia's revenue is expected to more than double this year to $125.6 billion, according to the average forecast of analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Next year, the chipmaker's fiscal year 2026, sales are expected to grow 44 percent to $181 billion.

Users can trade a Kamala Harris or Donald Trump contract starting Monday, said the company, as long as they meet certain criteria that include being a U.S. citizen. The trading is being offered through its Robinhood Derivatives unit and ForecastEx, which is operated by Interactive Brokers.

Robinhood jumps into a suddenly crowded politics prediction markets field that grew this month after platform Kalshi won a key ruling against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which was seeking to stop the election outcome trading. The CFTC is appealing the ruling. Shortly after, Interactive Brokers launched various political contracts, including on the election.

The election markets have generated some controversary this year with some concerned about light volume allowing the markets to be skewed. International platform Polymarket said last week that a single French user was responsible for four accounts spending millions to buy the Trump contract. But Polymarket said an investigation found the trading was not manipulating the market.

“We believe event contracts give people a tool to engage in real-time decision-making, unlocking a new asset class that democratizes access to events as they unfold,” said Robinhood in a statement. For now, only the presidential election contracts will be available to trade on the system.

Odds and gambling platforms do not use methodologies used by traditional political polling, and therefore are not substitutes for political polls.

Are there any specific technical indicators, chart patterns, or fundamental red flags that tend to give you the green light? Or maybe particular market conditions that you feel make a short play more likely to pay off?

Any insights or setups you rely on would be awesome! Thanks in advance.",2024-10-27,0.9809,Positive,[]
Would the implementation of 24/5 trading at NYSE have implications for options and theta in general?,1gd6rec,Still_Air2415,2024-10-27 14:26:55,30,0.81,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gd6rec/would_the_implementation_of_245_trading_at_nyse/,"It’s already public news that the NYSE is setting forth the agenda of creating 22hr/day trading as a result of tensions from Robinhood’s trading hours. 

The question begets, let me preface this by saying I am in no means an options expert or have my toes dipped deep in the realms of options trading in general, but the natural question that arises from such an implementation would ultimately be - how does this affect option pricing and trading in general?

Currently, non-fut options are being traded from 9:30-5PM EST, that is a timespan of ~7-8 hours a day. Technically, if I’m able to trade options for 3x the duration, what would the underlying implications of this be in terms of delta and theta variances?

DOJ explaining why you should invest in Visa ,1gcy62i,thelastsubject123,2024-10-27 05:15:07,183,0.92,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gcy62i/doj_explaining_why_you_should_invest_in_visa/,"Excerpt is from their lawsuit against V


5. As a result, debit networks face what Visa calls ""a chicken-and-egg problem."" To be successful, the network needs many issuers and acquirers to accept the network. But issuers are unlikely to join the debit network unless many merchants already use the network. And merchants are unlikely to join the network unless their customers have cards that work with the network, which requires the issuer to have activated the network. As Visa itself observes, ""build[ing] scale on both sides... with consumers/payers and with merchants/payees"" is ""a herculean task."" Visa further recognizes that these effects create ""an enormous moat"" around its business.

6. Visa's market shares demonstrate just how deep that moat is. Visa has been the largest debit network in the United States for decades. Today, over 60% of all U.S. debit transactions run via Visa's payments network. And Visa's share of card-not-present debit transactions exceeds 65%. Mastercard is a distant second, processing less than 25% of all U.S. debit transactions and card-not-present U.S. debit transactions. Other networks, known as ""PIN networks"" because they originally facilitated ATM transactions for which accountholders needed to enter a PIN, are significantly smaller.

7. This moat is no accident. Coming out of the Great Recession, Visa identified two significant threats to its monopoly—one from legislation and one from emerging technology. Visa took steps to counter both, enriching itself handsomely in the process.

Why Cancel shares instead of convert to Treasury shares during Buyback?,1gcvzz0,VegetaIsSuperior,2024-10-27 03:28:02,29,0.79,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gcvzz0/why_cancel_shares_instead_of_convert_to_treasury/,"Greetings, when a company does share buybacks (i.e. share repurchase), my understanding is that it must either cancel those shares or hold them as treasury shares.

  
Why would a company cancel the shares as opposed to holding onto them as treasury shares?

  
My limited thinking would be that converting them to treasury shares would be better as: (1) the company would retain the ability to reissue them at a later date, (2) the company would limit outside ownership (e.g. prevent hostile takeover), and (3) the company would still retain the ability to always cancel the shares in the future.

Comparable restaurant sales increased 8.5% at company restaurants and increased 7.2% at domestic franchise restaurants

Average weekly sales at company restaurants were $149,176 of which $18,914 were to-go sales as compared to average weekly sales of $138,668 of which $17,058 were to-go sales in the prior year

Restaurant margin dollars increased 24.1% to $202.1 million from $162.8 million in the prior year primarily due to higher sales. Restaurant margin, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, increased to 16.0% from 14.6% in the prior year driven primarily by higher sales. The benefit of a higher average guest check and improved labor productivity more than offset wage and other labor inflation of 4.7% and commodity inflation of 1.3%

Diluted earnings per share increased 32.5% primarily driven by higher restaurant margin dollars partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expenses

Seven company restaurants and three franchise restaurants were opened

Capital allocation spend included capital expenditures of $91.1 million, dividends of $40.7 million, and repurchases of common stock of $9.6 million.

Jerry Morgan, Chief Executive Officer of Texas Roadhouse, Inc. commented, “We are extremely pleased in such a competitive environment to report another quarter of continued traffic growth at each of our brands. This is a credit to the hard work of our operators who create an environment where Roadies want to work and guests want to dine.”

Morgan continued, “Looking ahead to 2025, we once again have a strong development pipeline and as of today already have 10 of our new company restaurants under construction. We remain confident that this new store growth along with our planned franchise acquisition and overall capital allocation strategy will allow us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value.”

The Company has tentatively agreed to acquire 13 domestic franchise restaurants with a targeted close date as of the beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. These acquisitions are subject to the completion of customary negotiations and due diligence.

NYSE plans to extend daily trading to 22 hours on its Arca exchange,1gc0koe,Repa24,2024-10-25 23:32:46,138,0.95,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gc0koe/nyse_plans_to_extend_daily_trading_to_22_hours_on/,"[https://www.ft.com/content/59dc109d-d385-412a-bcc6-b671db9ce680](https://www.ft.com/content/59dc109d-d385-412a-bcc6-b671db9ce680)

>The New York Stock Exchange announced plans to extend trading hours for equities on its Arca venue to 22 hours on weekdays, in an effort to meet global demand for buying and selling US-listed assets around the clock. NYSE, which is part of Intercontinental Exchange, said the extended trading hours for its all-electronic Arca exchange would cover 1:30am to 11:30pm Eastern time, excluding holidays. The proposed expansion, which targets a 2025 launch and is subject to approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission, follows the increased popularity in recent years of round-the-clock retail trading offered via brokerage platforms such as Robinhood and Interactive Brokers. “As the steward of the US capital markets, the NYSE is pleased to lead the way in enabling exchange-based trading for our US-listed companies and funds to investors in time zones across the globe,” Kevin Tyrrell, head of markets at the NYSE, said in a statement on Friday. NYSE plans to seek regulatory approval for the extended trading hours from the SEC as well as “US securities information processors”, such as the Consolidated Tape Association. The “tape” represents the official record of trading prices on exchanges, so the inclusion of night-time activity would be more likely to set the early tone for regular trading hours. NYSE Arca is best known as a venue for exchange traded funds and also hosts certain stocks and closed-end funds. Year-to-date, the Arca exchange has traded about $27.7bn a day in ETFs and about $21.8bn per day in corporate stocks, according to NYSE. It already has a broader operating window than the NYSE itself, with sessions running from 4am to 8pm Eastern time. Regular NYSE trading hours are 9.30am to 4pm Eastern time. Retail trading has boomed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the increased salience of cryptocurrencies. Assets such as US Treasuries, currencies and stock index futures can already be traded outside of normal exchange hours. That trend has put pressure on NYSE to consider widening its trading hours, and earlier this year prompted the group to poll market participants on the merits of trading stocks around the clock. Some retail brokers already offer 24/7 trading where trades overnight are matched through a “dark pool” venue that matches night-time trades in the US with daytime buying and selling in Asia.

75 people affected in E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounders: CDC,1gbyyx5,Puginator,2024-10-25 22:23:26,283,0.91,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gbyyx5/75_people_affected_in_e_coli_outbreak_linked_to/,"A deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounders has led to 75 cases in 13 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday, as it investigates the source of the spread. 

The outbreak has led to 22 hospitalizations and one previously reported death of an older adult in Colorado.

Out of 61 patients with information available, 22 have been hospitalized and two people have developed a serious condition that can cause kidney failure, called hemolytic uremic syndrome. All of the 42 people who were interviewed by the CDC reported eating at McDonald’s, while 39 people reported eating a beef hamburger, the agency said.

Those with infections ranged between ages 13 and 88, according to the CDC. The agency reiterated that the number of cases in the outbreak is likely much higher than what has been reported so far. The CDC added that the outbreak may not be limited to the states with related cases. That is because many patients do not test for E. coli and recover from an infection without receiving medical care, the CDC said. It also usually takes three to four weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

Shares of the restaurant chain fell 2% on the update. The stock is down 6% since the CDC announced the outbreak on Tuesday, initially citing 49 cases and one death across 10 states.

McDonald’s declined to comment on the update, citing the company’s statement when the outbreak was first announced.

Quarter Pounder hamburgers are a core menu item for McDonald’s, raking in billions of dollars annually.

Health officials are closely examining the slivered onions used in the Quarter Pounder as a likely contaminant. McDonald’s has instructed restaurants in the affected area to remove slivered onions from their supply, and has paused the distribution of that ingredient in the region.

McDonald’s stores in Colorado, Kansas, Utah, Wyoming as well as parts of Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico and Oklahoma have temporarily stopped using Quarter Pounder slivered onions and beef patties, according to the CDC.

McDonald’s identified California-based produce giant Taylor Farms as the supplier for the sliced onions the company removed from its supply chain. Taylor Farms has issued a recall on four raw onion products due to potential E. coli contamination. Burger King, Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell have pulled onions from select restaurants in response to the outbreak.

But federal agencies are also investigating the Quarter Pounder’s beef patty as a potential culprit.

As the CDC and other federal agencies trace cases and work to contain the outbreak, McDonald’s has pulled Quarter Pounders from restaurants in the affected areas. Around a fifth of McDonald’s U.S. restaurants are not selling Quarter Pounder burgers.

McDonald’s spokespeople said Wednesday that it is too early to tell if the outbreak is having any effect on traffic to its restaurants.

The company is expected to report its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday and could share more details with investors about the situation on the conference call.

The outbreak comes after several quarters of sluggish U.S. sales for McDonald’s. Price-sensitive consumers have not been visiting restaurants as much, leading McDonald’s and other fast-food chains to turn to value meals to boost sales. Wall Street analysts are expecting the company to report U.S. same-store sales growth of 0.5% for the third quarter, according to StreetAccount estimates.

For now, McDonald’s is trying to reassure customers that its menu items are safe to eat and drink and that it is taking the outbreak seriously. Experts told CNBC that barring a more serious crisis, the damage to its brand may be minimal, as with an E. coli outbreak linked to Wendy’s two years ago.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Tesla stock has best day in over a decade on Musk's 2025 growth projection,1gbcgse,Puginator,2024-10-25 01:55:58,558,0.8,387,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gbcgse/tesla_stock_has_best_day_in_over_a_decade_on/,"Tesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock’s best day since 2013, following the company’s better-than-expected earnings report.

The company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.

“We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.

Tesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.

Automakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.

Tesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”

CEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.

Even bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock, called Musk’s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a “maybe.” They set their estimate at 14%.

It “clearly depends on the company’s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers and improved features,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday.

A grain of salt

Musk said on the Wednesday call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.

Bernstein analysts, who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla, wrote in a note out Thursday: “The tone of Tesla’s conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors, and was more akin to a pep rally, with the company only taking two questions from sell-siders.”

Musk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn’t happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete. 

The Bernstein analysts wrote, “We continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis, and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away.”

They pointed to Musk’s “long history of being overly optimistic about FSD” and said crowdsourced research that shows “Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors” on robotaxis.

The share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24% gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla’s loss for the year and left the stock up 3% in 2024, though it still trails the 22% gain for the Nasdaq.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/09/25/us-firm-eliminated-from-race-build-britain-first-mini-nuke/

The naysayers are stating due to unproven technology, nobody wants to be the 1st guinea pig.  It is costly upfront and if something goes wrong they might be on hook in fines and penalties (hazardous material handling).

But this said... recently, the Biden admin has greenlit financial assistance approval for nuclear energy related projects.  

China and Russia already have approved SMRs and I believe they have a few already up and running.  

The unfairness is that - their gov't can absorb the costs if something goes wrong. 

Questions

1. Why doesn't the US gov't go a little deeper into the projects and bear some of the costs/potential dangers associated with it? 

2. Big companies like Amazon and Google have signed up partnerships with energy companies for SMR to be designed/built.  Why don't they just partner with a company like NuScale instead (approved SMR design)?

At the end of day, in 10 years... if energy infrastructure stays the way it is - the US could be way behind Russia/China in terms of energy source/efficienct. Nevermind inability to power many data centers etc. and not ability to meet its clean energy goals.

The timeline is uncertain, but if I were to guess, there could be up to four store locations around each city by YE 2025.

CAVA has had enormous success since their summer 2023 IPO (up 208%). The Company has around 330 locations across 28 states, with a stated goal of 1000 locations by 2032. There are concerns from some that the Company is currently way overvalued, while others contend that the market is only pricing in some of the growth and white space ahead.

"Tesla’s Not a Car Company, Musk’s in the Business of Selling the Future. And 5 Other Things to Know Today.",1gb1w72,Guy_PCS,2024-10-24 18:22:29,0,0.3,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gb1w72/teslas_not_a_car_company_musks_in_the_business_of/,"

It may surprise some to learn that Tesla isn’t really in the car business.

Sure, some 80% of its revenue currently comes from electric vehicles. And CEO Elon Musk is pretty good at squeezing profit out of those cars—something many in the industry still haven’t managed to figure out.

But the most important thing to know about the company is that it trades on more than 70 times forward earnings. Ford and General Motors are on five or six times. This suggests that when investors buy Tesla stock, their expectations are in a different universe from when they buy into other car makers.

Musk is pulling old-school levers to ensure his cars are profitable, even as rivals churn out lower-cost models. It helps that Tesla can now make more vehicles from the same manufacturing base and squeeze suppliers to cushion margins.

At the same time, a closer look at the earnings yesterday—which beat Wall Street estimates—show Tesla’s profits come from plenty of other sources. It made money from software, from selling regulatory credits for making more than its share of zero-emission cars, and from battery storage and charging.

Of course, robotaxis and self-driving cars are the next frontier. They’re not really cars—the robotaxi won’t even have a steering wheel or pedals. They are a bet on technology and artificial intelligence, not the automotive industry. It’s why Tesla is one of Nvidia’s best customers.

There’s a story about Ray Kroc, the businessman who made McDonald’s the most successful fast-food corporation, and the value of knowing exactly what business you’re really in. For McDonald’s, it’s real estate, not hamburgers.

Elon Musk knows he’s not in the car business. He’s selling the future. The tricky part will be delivering on his promises when expectations are already so high.

"Nvidia supplier SK Hynix posts record Q3 profit, beats forecasts",1gara3z,thelastsubject123,2024-10-24 07:09:10,97,0.94,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gara3z/nvidia_supplier_sk_hynix_posts_record_q3_profit/,"SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's SK Hynix on Thursday posted a record quarterly profit as the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) supplier saw strong sales of its advanced chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) ones used in generative AI chipsets.

The world's second-biggest memory chipmaker reported a 7 trillion won ($5.07 billion) operating profit for the July-September quarter versus a 1.8 trillion won loss a year earlier.

That compared with a 6.8 trillion won average forecast by LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward analysts who are more consistently accurate.

SK Hynix has outperformed rivals Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) in recent quarters, as it has benefited the most from AI-driven appetite for high-end memory chips following its early entry and large investments in HBM chip development.

""HBM sales showed excellent growth, up more than 70% from the previous quarter and more than 330% from the same period last year,"" SK Hynix said in a statement.

SK Hynix sees HBM sales making up 40% of its total DRAM revenue in the fourth quarter, up from 30% in the third quarter, and added it expects memory chip demand for AI servers to grow further next year as global tech companies continue developing generative AI.

Revenue for the quarter rose 94% year-on-year to 17.6 trillion won.

SK Hynix shares have jumped 38.5% so far this year, outperforming Samsung, whose stocks has slumped 24.7% over the same period.

Last month, SK Hynix, the main supplier of HBM chips to Nvidia, said it had started mass production of HBM3E 12-layer chips and plans to supply the latest products to unidentified customers by the end of this year.",2024-10-24,0.9843,Positive,"['SEOUL', 'SK', 'NVDA', 'HBM', 'AI', 'LSEG', 'SK', 'KS', 'MU', 'AI', 'HBM', 'HBM', 'SK', 'SK', 'HBM', 'DRAM', 'AI', 'AI', 'SK', 'SK', 'HBM']"
Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat,1gak7c4,thelastsubject123,2024-10-24 01:46:25,337,0.79,479,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gak7c4/tesla_shares_jump_6_on_profit_beat/,"* Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

# 

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.

# More than just EVs

Tesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. ""As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time,"" noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.

# Balance sheet

Tesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.

**SUMMARY**

We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.

Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our ""We, Robot"" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.

The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.

Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.",2024-10-24,0.9959,Positive,"['LSEG', 'GAAP', 'EV', 'TSLA', 'COGS', 'EV', 'AI']"

Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025?,1ga9gk5,DanielBeuthner,2024-10-23 18:05:32,0,0.41,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ga9gk5/alphabet_to_7_trillion_by_2025/,"We believe Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is positioned to grow its valuation by well over 3x from the already huge $2-trillion figure now – potentially becoming the world’s most valuable company by a huge margin – as its often-overlooked Waymo autonomous driving business quietly revolutionizes the transportation sector. This would take the stock to over $500 a share. Here’s why.

Fact: Waymo has grown the number of weekly paid rides from 10,000 to over 100,000 in the last 12 months. It went from 50,000 weekly rides to 100,000 just in the last six months.

The growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive

Case in point: Uber does more than 200 million rides each week. Let’s let that sink in. So if autonomous rides can capture even half that market, that would mean 100 million rides per week. That’s about 1,000 times where Waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. At $30 per ride, we’re talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year.

But wait… there is more to the growth story

If Waymo is already delivering over 100,000 driverless rides, how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles? The shift could be massive. For each person hailing a cab, there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. Many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat, streaming Netflix, while they’re stuck behind the wheel.

In fact, early data backs this up. According to Earnest Analytics, Waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. People enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. Safety could also be another attraction. Waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to national rates for human-operated cars.

Investors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride-hailing market has substantial growth potential – it could easily expand by 2-3x. A $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn’t out of the question. This growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies.

But wait aren’t so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving?

Yes, but not all of them are making the same progress. Waymo has a head start in the market. Its main competitor, General Motor’s backed Cruise lost its driverless permits in California after a serious accident, making Waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in San Francisco. Uber exited its self-driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with Waymo to bring its services to the Uber app in some cities. While electric vehicle behemoth Tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self-driving space, given its large base of vehicles, it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its Robotaxi vehicle earlier this month.

Waymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. It uses a fleet equipped with high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and radar systems, creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And don’t forget Google’s got a secret weapon. It crowdsources annotated data such as CAPTCHA codes from its massive user base, using that to train its machine-learning models. That’s a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments.

The best part?

These are self-driving cars – no human drivers, no unions, no employee or contractor issues, and no human cost. While there will be other expenses, such as software development and battery costs, the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. Margins of 50% aren’t unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride-hailing models.

If Waymo can capture about one-third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market, it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. With a 50% margin, that’s a neat $150 billion in profits. What’s that worth? At a 30x earnings multiple, that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for Alphabet. Considering that Alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently, this could take the company’s market cap to over $6.5 trillion, or over $500 per share.

To be sure, building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time – quite different from signing up for say a Google or Netflix account. However, investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 (not 2025), maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck – if you’re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly, has the technology and competitive edge, and is addressing a potentially massive market, making this high valuation within reach.

"What does it mean when the stock price rises, while the short interest rises alongside it?",1g9zjwr,owter12,2024-10-23 07:39:35,0,0.42,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g9zjwr/what_does_it_mean_when_the_stock_price_rises/,"In the case of the stock CompoSecure (CMPO) ([info](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/cmpo)), I have the following data:

As you can see not only has the stock price increased dramatically but so has the short interest ([Nasdaq data](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/cmpo/short-interest)). Any possible explanation for this? What I’ve seen in the past is that if a stock has a high short interest, and the price gradually rises, typically, you’d see the short interest trend downward. However, it seems like the opposite is true for CMPO.

Any wrinkle brains willing to give an explanation?

TLT too low to be ignored?,1g9s9qx,Zurkarak,2024-10-23 02:01:07,5,0.6,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g9s9qx/tlt_too_low_to_be_ignored/,"Just wanted to share some thoughs about yields and bonds that ive heard recently that caught my eye, maybe get some feedback or different ideas. This in the context of 10YR yields that went from **3.7%** to **4.2%** after the FED made the 50bps. The FEDs mandate, as you all know, is to balance employment and inflation.

**Employment:**

Some of the climb in yields comes from the idea that the economy is strong, with the unemployment rate climbing to 4.3% in July and then dropping since. A Bloomberg columnist wrote an interesting piece that talked about the idea that unemployment rate hasn’t peaked yet, due to 3 factors that played a key role in the September report.

1. Hiring in the education sector after an earlier delay
2. Outsized election spending
3. Responses to natural disasters

According to her, the drop from 4.22% to 4.05% in the unemployment rate was almost entirely driven by a 785k increase in government jobs (3.6 standard deviation move), which was the second largest monthly jump in government hiring since January 1990. Meanwhile, other Jobs fell 355k and as a result, total employment rose 430k net according to household data. Some possible explanations for the unusual increase in government hiring could be:

* The fast hiring in education, probably due to a later hiring schedule.
* A surge in hiring related to the presidential election — campaign-related activity saw an unusual increase in federal-level protective services in several swing states and Illinois — added 200,000 jobs, by their estimate.
* Emergency personnel related to reconstruction after damage by Hurricane Beryl and wildfires likely contributed about 100,000 jobs.

By their calculus, without the election cycle boost and the impact from natural disasters, the unemployment rate would have been 4.23%. Their conclusion is that those effects should persist in a lesser way in October but start reversing in December and expect a 4.5% by EOY.

**Inflation:**

Now let’s turn to the actual inflation data, the breakdown of the components of inflation ***~~(THERE SHOULD BE AN IMAGE HERE BUT THIS SUB DOESNT ALLOW GRAPHS AND STUFF).~~***

Services is the one big component that keeps pushing inflation higher, with Core Goods and energy contributing negatively to inflation (meaning they are showing lower prices now). What’s in the Services category? Well I have this table cause I got too lazy to make another graph: ***~~(THERE SHOULD BE A TABLE HERE TOO)~~***

Most of the inflation comes from Shelter, Medical Care Services and transportation services. Let’s talk about Shelter specifically. Everybody here knows that the housing market is nuts right now, there is not enough new supply to cover the demand, and the existing supply is locked due to the high mortgages. The idea here is basically that HIGHER INTEREST RATES WON’T alleviate this component, lower rates might help actually due to unlocking existing houses in the market.

Finally, last week we got retail sales that spooked some participants, but we already know that goods have been in negative territory for the last months so there shouldn’t be much problem there.

**Trade:**

Ive been shorting the TLT puts for a while, closed most of them when we got the 50 bps cut and then as we came down ive been adding. I did some of them too soon I think. Anyhow this are my positions:

* Long TLT shares
* Short Dec 20 puts, Strikes: $100, 95, 93, 90
* Short Nov 08 calls, $96.5 just to cover some of the long exposure

I think worst case I’d end up getting assigned a bunch of TLT into 2025 and going into the new year basically all in on TLT. I am getting worried tho because recently ive heard a lot of commentary about FED making a mistake with people like Stanley Druckenmiller shorting bonds with convincing arguments.

Starbucks shares slide after preliminary results show sales fell again,1g9rywb,Puginator,2024-10-23 01:48:32,235,0.96,143,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g9rywb/starbucks_shares_slide_after_preliminary_results/,"Starbucks on Tuesday posted preliminary quarterly results, which showed its sales fell again.

Nearly two months ago, CEO Brian Niccol took the helm of the coffee giant after two quarters of same-store sales declines.

He aims to reverse slowing demand for Starbucks’ drinks, particularly in its two largest markets: the United States and China. In the U.S., the chain has been losing its occasional customers, who have opted to save money instead of spending on its macchiatos and Refreshers. Starbucks’ business in China has also been struggling to recover ever since the pandemic, and the rise of cheaper local rivals like Luckin Coffee and a more cautious consumer have dented sales in recent months.

Niccol joined Starbucks after six years as CEO of Chipotle; during his tenure at the fast-casual chain, he led the company through a turnaround after its foodborne illness crises, invested in its digital business and turned it into a top industry performer, even during the pandemic.

To curb Starbucks’ sales slump, Niccol plans to turn first to the company’s struggling U.S. business. In an open letter released during his first week on the job, he said he plans to focus on four areas of improvement: the barista experience, morning service, its cafes and the company’s branding.

Niccol has also been reshuffling the company’s executive ranks. On Friday, the company announced a former Chipotle executive, Tressie Lieberman, will be joining Starbucks as its global chief brand officer, a newly created position. And last month, Starbucks said its North American CEO Michael Conway would retire after just five months in the role; Niccol’s predecessor Laxman Narasimhan had appointed Conway before his ouster in August.

Shares of Starbucks are up 1% this year, as of Tuesday’s close. The company has a market cap of more than $109 billion.

The company is expected to report its fiscal-fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Oct. 30.

I've been thinking of ways to profit off of potential war spiking oil up and Trump winning the election bext month. Obvious plays would be Oil or DJT respectively, but both are iffy at best. That's where I'd remembered that I've invested a few times into Halliburton $HAL, mostly swinging it for 20% and it's that time of the year again.

So what's their business? - Halliburton is one of the largest oil field service companies in the world. It provides a wide range of services and products to the energy industry, with a primary focus on oil and natural gas exploration, development, and production. Halliburton operates in over 70 countries and serves both national and independent oil and gas companies. I'll use ChatGPT to summarise the business underlying.

So what's my conviction? - You've got two ways to profit off of this business plus a large safety net in the form of a relative undervaluation. Technically speaking, the company is trading near the multi-years bottoms and the business has improved since.   
1st case: Drill baby, drill! - In case of Trump delivering on his promises to increase the rate of drilling, Halliburton profits, as it's literally their business

2nd case: Israel - Iran war breaking out - Oil is bound to increase in price as the risks increase and or the fields in the middle east get destroyed. In any case, since the company is in the Oil sector, it's bound to increase in price  
3rd case: None of these above happen - You've got a profitable, dividend paying company trading under the intrinsic value, that is projected to increase in price as per analysts' view - Lowest 52w target is still SIGNIFICANTLY above the current price

# Business breakdown (done using ChatGPT, please don't stone me)

1. **Completion and Production**
   * Services and products related to the completion of oil and gas wells, such as well cementing, stimulation (including hydraulic fracturing), and production enhancement.
   * Includes tools and systems that help improve oil and gas well output.
2. **Drilling and Evaluation**:
   * Provides services like directional drilling, well logging, and reservoir evaluation.
   * Offers technologies and services that help customers locate oil and gas reserves and understand reservoir characteristics.

# Major Services and Products:

* **Drilling Services**: Including equipment, tools, and techniques to drill and stabilize oil wells.
* **Hydraulic Fracturing**: A key service for extracting oil and natural gas from unconventional resources like shale.
* **Cementing**: Securing well integrity and preventing leaks between rock formations and drilled areas.
* **Artificial Lift**: Techniques and tools that help lift oil from the well to the surface when the reservoir pressure isn't sufficient.

I'm currently invested in at about 7.5% of my portfolio @ $28.3, ready to double down if it drops, as I trully believe this could be a good hedge againts war and possibly even major recession - Oil tends to get expensive

Walmart will start delivering prescriptions as CVS and Walgreens struggle,1g9hzoe,Puginator,2024-10-22 18:51:24,73,0.96,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g9hzoe/walmart_will_start_delivering_prescriptions_as/,"As CVS and Walgreens shutter hundreds of stores nationwide to shore up profits and investor sentiment, Walmart said Tuesday that it is offering a new option for customers: Delivering prescriptions to their doorsteps.

The nation’s largest retailer said deliveries are now available in six states: Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin. The company said in a news release that it expects to deliver prescriptions in 49 states by the end of January. Prescription deliveries will not be available in North Dakota due to state laws, Walmart said.

The prescription delivery service is another example of how Walmart is trying to outmatch competitors on convenience along with low prices. With the new service, customers can get a mix of items dropped off during the same delivery, such as a box of tissues, blanket or chicken noodle soup.

Walmart’s new delivery offering could be another blow to drugstore chains, which are falling out of favor with consumers in a trend that has hit their profits and stock prices and forced them to reconsider their strategies. Still, it is unclear how much market share Walmart could win from CVS and Walgreens, both of which offer same-day, one-day and two-day prescription deliveries.

Tom Ward, chief e-commerce officer for Walmart U.S., said the company added pharmacy deliveries because of shopper demand.

“This is actually the number one service requested by our customers,” he said.

He said Walmart tested the deliveries in several states and saw that customers took advantage of getting a mix of items, including the prescription, in a single delivery.

Walmart’s delivery service will be available for new prescriptions and refills, the company said. It will cost $9.95 for a delivery, the standard price for Walmart doorstep deliveries, but will be free for members of Walmart+, the company’s membership program.

Health insurance plans will be applied to the transaction, like they would in the store, the company said.

The deliveries will come with a few more safety steps than Walmart’s other deliveries, the company said: Medications will be put into tamper-evident packaging. Customers can track orders in real time through Walmart’s app or website and get a photo in the app or by email when the prescription is delivered. And when a customer orders a new prescription and chooses delivery, they are prompted to do a consultation with the pharmacy by phone.

Most of Walmart’s annual revenue in the U.S. – nearly 60% – comes from groceries, but health and wellness is a growing category for the company, according to the retailer’s most recent annual filing for the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31. Health and wellness accounts for about 12% of its annual revenue in the U.S. It includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, optical services and other clinical services.

As of Monday’s close, shares of Walmart were up around 54% for the year. Meanwhile, shares of CVS were down roughly 26% so far this year, while shares of Walgreens were down nearly 60%.

CVS is the top U.S. pharmacy in terms of prescription drug revenue, holding more than 25% of the market share in 2023, according to Statista data released in March. Walgreens trailed behind with nearly 15% of that share last year, while Walmart held just 5% of that share.

CVS and Walgreens are grappling with falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs. Inflation, softer consumer spending and competition from Amazon, big-box retailers and grocery stores are making it difficult for them to turn a profit at the front of the store, which carries cleaning supplies, beauty products and pantry staples, among other items.

CVS CEO Karen Lynch left the company and was replaced by David Joyner last week, as CVS faces pressure from Wall Street and, more recently, an activist investor to turn around its business. On top of the leadership shakeup, CVS plans to cut $2 billion in expenses over several years. That includes slashing less than 1% of its workforce, or roughly 2,900 jobs, on the corporate side of its business.

The company is also wrapping up a three-year plan to close 900 of its stores, with 851 locations closed as of August.

Walgreens is similarly cutting costs, announcing last week that it will close roughly 1,200 stores over the next three years, which includes 500 in fiscal 2025 alone. The chain has around 8,700 locations in the U.S., a quarter of which it says are unprofitable.

Walmart has faced its own financial challenges on the health-care side of the business. The discounter planned to bring its low-price spin to health care by opening clinics that offered doctor, dentist and therapy appointments for less.

Yet in the spring, Walmart shuttered all of the clinics, saying in a news release at the time that it couldn’t operate a profitable business because of “the challenging reimbursement environment and escalating operating costs.”

"Peloton partners with Costco to sell Bike+ as it looks to reach young, wealthy customers",1g9hynq,Puginator,2024-10-22 18:50:05,82,0.85,101,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g9hynq/peloton_partners_with_costco_to_sell_bike_as_it/,"Peloton’s stationary bikes will soon sell at Costco’s stores and on its website as the beleaguered fitness company looks for new ways to reach younger and affluent customers, Peloton is set to announce Tuesday.

Under the terms of the deal, Costco will offer Peloton’s Bike+ in 300 of its U.S. stores for $1,999, and on Costco.com for $2,199 between Nov. 1 and Feb. 15. It is a steep discount from the typical price of the Bike+, which is selling on Peloton’s website for $2,495. It is unclear how the price will compare to any holiday promotions Peloton plans to offer. 

The new partnership comes during a state of transition for Peloton, which is being led by two board members after its former CEO Barry McCarthy stepped down earlier this year.

Long focused on growth at all costs, Peloton has turned its sights to profitability and has had to become more creative as it tries to reach new users.

As sales fall and losses mount, Peloton is looking for cheaper ways to attract new customers. Costco is one way to get there, Dion Camp Sanders, Peloton’s chief emerging business officer, told CNBC in an interview. 

“We’ve been able to architect a deal with Costco that meets our needs with regard to profitable, sustainable unit economics, while at the same time delivering robust and clear value to Costco members,” said Camp Sanders. “We’ve structured this deal with Costco to both meet our needs for profitable, sustainable growth and getting us access to Costco’s very large net incremental audience.” 

Camp Sanders said Peloton’s partnership with Costco is only for a limited time because fitness is a seasonal category for the company, but Peloton hopes to keep building on the relationship and perhaps expand it to future locations both in the U.S. and abroad.

The deal with Costco gets Peloton onto the shelves of a retailer with a strong fan following and wealthier customers. The membership-based club has gained popularity as shoppers across all incomes prioritize value and try to get more for their money with bulk packs and private-label items.

As of Sept. 1, store traffic at Costco had increased 31% compared with the same period in pre-pandemic 2019, according to Placer.ai, an analytics company that estimates visits to locations based on smartphone data. 

Costco’s members are also getting younger. Those consumers prioritize health and wellness — and are willing to invest in it — in ways that older generations do not. 

About half of Costco’s new membership sign-ups last fiscal year came from people who were under 40 years old, and the average age of its 76 million members has fallen since the Covid-19 pandemic, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said on an earnings call in late September. 

According to Numerator, 36% of Costco’s customers have a household income of more than $125,000. Numerator has a panel of 150,000 U.S. consumers that is balanced to be representative of the country’s population.

Camp Sanders said Costco’s members “have the disposable income to be able to afford our premium products,” and their lifestyles align with what Peloton offers. 

“Many of Peloton’s members are affluent, they often have larger homes in the suburbs and they also have life situations where Peloton fits a clear need,” said Camp Sanders. “Many Costco members are juggling families, they maybe have a busy career … and they’ve got the space in their home” to build their own gyms, he continued. 

Costco’s Executive Vice President of Merchandising Claudine Adamo declined to comment to CNBC.

Peloton already sells its workout equipment through Amazon and Dick’s Sporting Goods, but has also been working to develop relationships with other companies that cater to similar customer bases. 

For example, hundreds of Hyatt Hotel properties have Peloton equipment on site. As of this month, hotel members can earn points for completing workouts on the Peloton Bike and Row during their stay. 

It also announced a deal with Truemed — the PayPal of the health savings account and flexible spending account world — that allows Peloton members to use pretax earnings to buy certain hardware products, including the Bike, Bike+ and Tread.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Big Share Growth Potential with Low P/E and High EPS Projection: Golden Entertainment (GDEN),1g8xfhj,Really_Schruted_It,2024-10-22 00:18:59,0,0.47,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g8xfhj/big_share_growth_potential_with_low_pe_and_high/,"Disclosure: I own both stock and calls for GDEN that I plan on holding past the earnings on 11/7.  Do your own research too!

TLDR: P/E ratio significantly lower than industry average (3.3 vs. >15), favorable foot-traffic and occupancy data, Marketbeat predicts over $500 earnings growth over the next year

Golden Entertainment (NASDAQ: GDEN) offers a compelling opportunity for value investors, thanks to its attractive valuation, strategic growth, and improving foot traffic trends. Here’s why GDEN deserves a closer look.

**Key Fundamentals and Considerations**

1. **Valuation:**
   * **P/E Ratio:** 3.35 (vs. sector peers like Sands at 24, MGM at 15 and Wynn at 13). This suggests GDEN is deeply undervalued compared to the market​
2. **Improving Hotel Performance:**
   * **STRAT Hotel and Casino** achieved **record revenue** in Q2 2024.
   * **ADR increased by 8%**, with **occupancy rising 4%** YoY to 73%.
   * Weekend occupancy hit an impressive **97%**, while midweek occupancy improved to **64%**, demonstrating growing visitor traffic
3. **Earnings Call on November 7, 2024:**
   * With a projected **516% EPS increase** over the next year, the upcoming earnings call could trigger significant upside. (Marketbeat)

**Risks to Monitor**

* **Insider Sales:** Recent sales by insiders reflect cautious profit-taking but not necessarily a lack of confidence, as insiders still retain significant holdings​
* **Sector Volatility:** While improving, hospitality and gaming sectors remain sensitive to macroeconomic conditions.

**Conclusion:** potential high value play with growth potential

Golden Entertainment’s rising foot traffic, particularly at the STRAT, coupled with its undervaluation, makes it an intriguing investment. With growing momentum in its core Nevada operations and expansion in tavern locations, GDEN offers a promising blend of growth and value.",2024-10-22,0.994,Positive,"['GDEN', 'TLDR', 'GDEN', 'GDEN', 'MGM', 'GDEN', 'STRAT', 'ADR', 'EPS', 'STRAT', 'GDEN']"

Disney will name new CEO in early 2026; Gorman to become board chair next year,1g8oo5x,Puginator,2024-10-21 18:08:52,132,0.94,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g8oo5x/disney_will_name_new_ceo_in_early_2026_gorman_to/,"Disney has tapped James Gorman to replace Mark Parker as the company’s next chairman, effective in January, as the media giant lays the groundwork to name a successor for CEO Bob Iger in early 2026, the company said Monday.

Gorman joined Disney’s board less than a year ago and was named the head of the succession planning committee in August. He will continue to lead that committee after he takes over as board chairman from Nike Executive Chairman Parker.

“The Disney board has benefited tremendously from James Gorman’s expertise and guidance, and we are lucky to have him as our next chairman – particularly as the board continues to move forward with the succession process,” Iger said in a statement. “I’m extremely grateful to Mark Parker for his many years of board service and leadership, which have been so valuable to this company and its shareholders, and to me as CEO.”

Parker will step down after nine years on the Disney board “to focus on other areas” of his work, according to a Disney statement. That includes spending more time working on Nike-related matters, according to a person familiar with the matter. Elliott Hill took over as Nike CEO last week, replacing John Donahoe.

Early 2026

Disney had initially targeted 2025 to announce a successor, as CNBC reported last year. Pushing the date back to early 2026 will give the board more time to conduct due diligence on both internal and external candidates, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.

Gorman has experience with succession planning: He oversaw the orderly transfer of power at Morgan Stanley, with Ted Pick succeeding him as CEO there at the start of this year.

Succession hasn’t been smooth at Disney. The board fired Iger’s handpicked successor, Bob Chapek, in November 2022 after a turbulent tenure that lasted less than three years. Iger returned to the CEO job, and now, Disney shareholders are eager to see a succession plan stick.

Iger’s four direct reports — ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, Disney Experiences Chairman Josh D’Amaro, and Disney Entertainment Co-Chairmen Dana Walden and Alan Bergman — have all interviewed with the succession committee in recent weeks, since Gorman took over in August, according to the people familiar.

Gorman said in a CNBC interview in March, before taking over as the board’s succession chair, that Disney was running a “forward-looking, forward-leaning, incredibly disciplined process.”

Still, while putting a specific timeline on naming a successor adds a bit of clarity to the search, it also means the question of who will take over for Iger will continue to hover over the company for another year.

Iger has pushed back his retirement five different times to continue to lead Disney as CEO. Activist investor Nelson Peltz focused on the board’s failure to name a lasting successor in his unsuccessful campaign to gain board seats earlier this year.

Iger’s current contract as CEO runs until Dec. 31, 2026. He and the board haven’t decided if Iger will extend his board tenure past 2026, said the people familiar.

Goldman Sachs predicts only 3% annualized returns of S&P500 over the next decade,1g8nneq,Silgro94,2024-10-21 17:14:01,816,0.87,564,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g8nneq/goldman_sachs_predicts_only_3_annualized_returns/,"According to Goldman Sachs forecast, S&P500 will give only 3% annualized return over next 10 years which is bellow average of S&P500 returns in last 100 years (11% per year on average).

Do you believe in forecasts from financial institutions or in any forecasts at all?

In your opinion, how often are financial institutions wrong with their predictions?

Will you change your investing strategy if other financial institutions give similar forecasts of S&P500 returns?

Altimmune  management has continuously stated: **We want a partner at the Phase 3 Trial design meeting with the FDA**

Meeting, as per PR, early November. Therefore, a partner anticipated to be announce any day now. Though, to be honest - we have been waiting for a year now. Altimmune, unlike others, is in advanced stages and has FAST TRACK STATUS.

If this comes true, retail can sit in a warm bath together with Sexy Institutions and Shorts.

* Institutional ownership 63%, 43 million
* Short 31%, 22 million
   * **Do the math: Retail left-overs?**

===============================

A bit of DD mixed with opinion:

1. **Why $ALT over $VKTX?**
   * VKTX-2735 < PEMVI 2.4mg -- PEMVI superior quality of Weight Loss as measured by % FAT vs. % LEAN reduction (i.e. the KEY next-gen GLP1 metric)
   * PEMVI broad CARDIOVASCULAR activity/potential
   * PEMVI MOA includes Thermogenic/RMR component for LT use
   * PEMVI body recomp. potential via class-leading lean muscle preservation
   * PEMVI P3 titration/DR design to 'fix' outlier 48wk P2 (other PEMVI studies have shown tolerability on par with VK2735)
   * VK2735 is faster WL which is better for BMI 40+ class 3 Obesity (smaller market), but not for avg. person -- VK to compete with $LLY Zep,
   * PEMVI is SIGNIFICANTLY differentiated high quality Next-gen GLP1 WL
   * VKTX-2809 < PEMVI 1.8mg -- PEMVI rapid liver defatting in 6-12 wks (MASLD)
   * PEMVI better 24wk anti-fibrotic potential vs 52wk VKTX
   * PEMVI bypasses thyroid and is leading GLP1 liver MOA
2. **Why is Viking valued at 50$ and Altimmune at 6$?**
   * Viking Management simply is better at managing their stock. Viking has 900 million in cash, which they simply raised in a brilliant way.
   * Altimmune had a short report to endure, in which Kerrisdale stupidly rehashed old data, BUT Altimmune management FAILED at protecting the stock they let Jefferies do their bidding.
   * Altimmune cash runway 150 million (or so), they stupidly ran the ATM at the absolute wrong moment.
3. **But why is Altimmune still the better stock?**
   * Pemvi as explained above, is smarter. Not Obesity, but curative fatty liver - COVERED BY INSURANCE ALREADY. Which pure obesity drugs are not, like Zepbound Wegovy
   * Altimmune has FAST TRACK status. A nugget overseen by many
   * Altimmune has a much much larger upside, at this moment. The odds of Viking crashing, extremely high. They are a Bio, they will face a setback. I believe if Viking was to be bought now, it would be at 100$ per share
   * If Altimmune was to be bought now, 40$-75$ per share would be fair.
   * If Altimmune announces a partner, it will likely be a 20$ 30$ stock within days.",2024-10-21,0.9622,Positive,"['FDA', 'PR', 'FAST', 'TRACK', 'VKTX', 'VKTX', 'VAT', 'DD', 'ALT', 'VKTX', 'VKTX', 'PEMVI', 'PEMVI', 'FAT', 'LEAN', 'KEY', 'PEMVI', 'PEMVI', 'MOA', 'RMR', 'LT', 'PEMVI', 'PEMVI', 'DR', 'PEMVI', 'WL', 'BMI', 'VK', 'LLY', 'PEMVI', 'WL', 'VKTX', 'PEMVI', 'PEMVI', 'MASLD', 'PEMVI', 'VKTX', 'PEMVI', 'MOA', 'BUT', 'ATM', 'BY', 'FAST', 'TRACK']"

Ripe for picking - (FDMT) 4D Molecular Therapeutics?,1g86agq,yodalr,2024-10-21 00:34:51,8,0.68,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g86agq/ripe_for_picking_fdmt_4d_molecular_therapeutics/,"Their current pipeline focus ""4D-150"" is for treatment of Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

FDMT current market cap $443.30M

1. **Potential Market:**
   - 20 million US citizens aged 40 and older have AMD, with 200,000 new cases added each year.
   - 10-15% are Wet AMD, so 2-3 million affected.
   - Current treatment involves Anti-VEGF shots into the eye every 4-12 weeks (lifelong treatment, no cure).
   - Latest 4D-150 Phase 2 results show ""83% overall reduction in annualized injections through 52 weeks"" and ""70% injection-free through 52 weeks"".
   - It's RNA-based, so shots will need to be repeated eventually.
   - Current anti-VEGF treatment costs $13,875 to $24,000 per person annually.
   - Conservative estimate: 4D-150 priced at $15,000 per shot (likely 2-3x higher as it's gene therapy), capturing 20% of 2 million market = 400,000 patients.
   - **Potential annual revenue: $6 billion (400,000 * $15,000)**
   - Global anti-VEGF market: $12.3 billion in 2022, estimated $13.7 billion by 2031.
   - If 4D-150 captures 20% of that: $2.46 billion annually.
   - **Potential market cap: $7.38 billion (3x revenue)** - a 1463% increase from current value (assuming successful Phase 3 and market entry). Assuming it will take 3-5 years for the drug to hit the market, we are looking at 300%-500% annual yield.

2. **Safety:** ""Comparable to approved anti-VEGF agents"", suggesting likely Phase 3 success and market entry.

3. **Competition:**
   - Currently, no gene therapy drugs for AMD are on the market.
   - 23 gene therapy studies for AMD are in various stages of clinical trials.
   - Among these studies, only three companies are listed on NASDAQ:
   - FDMT, ADVM, RGNX
   - All at similar stages with comparable results (FDMT results slightly better (look at the ""Reduction in Annualized Anti-VEGF Injections"")).

4. **Finances:**
   - FDMT has $541.95M cash, sufficient until 2030 (based on current FCF of -$87.17M)
   - Competitors have 1.5-2 years of cash, likely facing dilution
   - FDMT's market cap should be way higher when compared to those direct competitors (imo).

5. **Stock Performance Paradox:**

Despite consistently positive results, FDMT's stock has experienced a significant decline. Here's a breakdown of the situation:

- Since February 5th presentation which lead to a huge upward spike, FDMT has released two additional analyses of their 4D-150 drug:
  - July 17 presentation
  - September 18 presentation
  - Both show even better numbers than the February results

**Potential Explanation for low stock price: Heavy Shorting**

- [This graph](https://i.imgur.com/xE0EjSx.jpeg) combines data from NASDAQ and StockAnalysis.com
- Between July 13-17 (after 2nd presentation release):
  - Short interest dropped from 10.3M to 9.5M
  - Spike in average daily share volume
- Interpretation: Short sellers likely closed positions after seeing good results, driving the price down

**Unexpected Consequence:**

- This triggered an investigation:
  > ""The investigation focuses on whether the Company issued false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose information pertinent to investors. 4D Molecular Therapeutics released the interim results of its Phase 2 PRISM study on Intravitreal 4D-150 on July 17, 2024. Despite the Company billing the results as positive, the stock fell by more than 35.8% in afternoon trading on the same day.""

- In my opinion, the current situation isn't related to securities fraud, but rather reflects the inherent volatility of the biotech market. However, the mere mention of 'securities fraud' has negatively impacted the company's stock profile, leading to further declines. This has been exacerbated by repeated dissemination of this news on Accesswire since July.
Consequently, short interest has increased significantly, currently **41.39%** of the float is shorted with a 7-day cover period. This level of short interest seems **CRAZY** for a promising pre-revenue biotech stock and suggests the potential for a short squ-eeze.
While the timing is uncertain, the combination of high short interest and extended cover period indicates a likelihood of future price increases.

I am thinking to put it all into VTSAX, and pull it out when it gets to 200k to pay them, or when something changes and her loans will start accruing interest again. 

Obviously ideally I’d make bank on stock market and loans wouldn’t accrue interest for a long while etc etc. so there’s money left over after repayment. But I want to be very realistic and careful as loosing that chunk would obviously put us back to square one.

Is a gamestop scenario happening in China right now？,1g79344,cyarui,2024-10-19 19:06:35,0,0.24,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g79344/is_a_gamestop_scenario_happening_in_china_right/,"JD.com (HKG: 9618, NASDAQ: JD), a Chinese e-commerce platform specializing in electronics and premium products, is well-known for its responsive customer support. However, the company has recently gained attention due to a controversial endorsement event by Yang Li, a talk show host known for her misandrist rhetoric and numerous remarks against geeks. Yang's involvement has previously been linked to significant stock price declines for other companies (e.g., 600702.SH, SHA: 600398, and others) that featured her in commercials or as a spokesperson.

Amidst ongoing heated gender debates in China, many of JD's male customers have mobilized through social media to express their discontent. Early actions included calls for JD Plus membership refunds and requests for VAT invoices on past purchases. To date, there have been over 300,000 posts across various social media platforms discussing this issue.

As of yesterday, netizens have escalated their response, withdrawing funds from JD-affiliated investment products and short-term funds. They have also advocated for using JD's lending services to withdraw as much money as possible within the one-month interest-free period, effectively triggering fears of a ""run"" on JD’s financial services. In response, [JD.com](http://JD.com) attempted to mitigate concerns by sending text messages to its financial service users, denying the existence of a run. Ironically, this only fueled further withdrawals, as people feared the situation was real.

Additionally, some users reported that certain JD Finance fund accounts had restricted redemptions, with payment accounts shifting from JD to liquidity borrowing accounts at China Industrial Bank. As of today, reports indicate that Industrial Bank's short-term liquidity funds have been depleted, prompting a further shift of payment accounts to Ping An Bank.

There was a 12% decline in JD's stock following the announcement of Yang Li as the spokesperson for their event. While there was a brief recovery on the 18th after JD issued an apology, many netizens deemed the apology insincere and continued to call for further action over the weekend.",2024-10-19,0.0772,Positive,"['JD', 'HKG', 'JD', 'SH', 'SHA', 'JD', 'JD', 'VAT', 'JD', 'JD', 'JD', 'JD', 'JD', 'JD', 'JD', 'JD', 'JD']"

Games Workshop - Hold or Sell?,1g6lt1l,Throwaway7131923,2024-10-18 21:36:54,17,0.78,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g6lt1l/games_workshop_hold_or_sell/,"In late August I bought €450 of Games Workshop stock.  
For those who don't know, Games Workshop (GW) is a hobby shop based in the UK but with stores across a range of countries in Europe, NA, the Commonwealth and China. The shop is most famous as the designers and producers of the Warhammer franchise.

Typically when I invest I just put money in funds because I don't think I can generally do a better job than professional traders. In this case, I came to the conclusion that the stock was undervalued for two reasons. (1) The stores had returned very healthy growth in the 2023/2024 financial year, including a healthy uptake in footfall (2) the market had underappreciated the impact of the Space Marine 2 game, set to come out in September, on future GW revenue. I'd seen some gameplay footage back in maybe July and was quite confident it was going to be a hit.

My plan was to buy the stock, hold until the half-year report in January and sell if I'm in profit.

Well it looks like I was right...   
GW have capitalized on the success of Space Marine 2 by selling a tie-in starter set.   
These have been selling like hot cakes according to folks I know who work in stores.  
Web chatter seems to agree that footfall is up.  
The markets seem to agree and the stock price has risen about 12% in a month.

All sounds good, right?   
I should stick to my original plan, hold till the January report and then sell when good sales figures buoy the stock price.

The big question mark, however, is an ongoing deal (or lack thereof) with Amazon to produce a small-screen Warhammer 40K series with Henry Cavill as the creative director. Cavill, for reference, is a long-time fan of the IP and is widely expected to do a good job, if a deal were to come through. However, the project has been under a degree of uncertainty following the general contraction of the streaming industry and GW have put a limit of the end of the year to come to a deal, or they're pulling the plug.

Obviously, if the TV show is announced, it could drive the stock price nice and high.  
But if the deal falls through, I'm concerned that this could set the stock back and offset the gains I've made.

So what do you all think?  
(1) Sell now. Bank a nice little return.  
(2) Hold till the January report and hope that there's good news on the Amazon deal, and/or a good half-year report.

Here’s why: Right now, AI might feel limited to things like ChatGPT, but its potential goes far beyond that. Over the next 3, 5, or 10 years, AI is going to transform industries in ways we can’t fully imagine yet. We’re talking about healthcare revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat patients, transportation with autonomous vehicles and drones making logistics smarter and more efficient, and manufacturing, where AI will optimize production processes and supply chains.

Now, I know what you're thinking: 'What, you think the world is full of cave dwellers? Who doesn't know that?' and you're right. Everyone knows AI techonology will be advanced and utilized in so many ways in the near future.

But look, you can think of it like real estate. Sure, property values rise while new highways or shopping centers are being built, but the real surge in value happens once people start using them and see the full benefits. Right now, AI is still in its “under construction” phase—people can imagine the future potential, but the true value hasn’t been fully realized yet. The market has priced in expectations, sure, but once AI is fully integrated across industries and we start seeing its widespread, real-world impact, I believe we’ll see another major surge in stock prices. What’s priced in now is just the beginning—the real growth will come as AI starts transforming daily life and business on a much larger scale.

Before ChatGPT went mainstream, people assumed ‘just’ that level of AI technology would arrive soon enough, but they didn’t think it would have this much of an impact on stock prices once it came to life for the public. Everyone knew advanced AI was on the horizon, but the market didn’t price it like they do now.

Nebius set to resume Nasdaq trading after completing split from Russia’s Yandex,1g6hrm7,Guy_PCS,2024-10-18 18:44:09,25,0.85,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g6hrm7/nebius_set_to_resume_nasdaq_trading_after/,"Oct 17 (Reuters) - AI infrastructure firm Nebius Group (NBIS.O), opens new tab said on Thursday its shares will resume Nasdaq trading on Monday after being halted following Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
At that time, the stock traded under the ticker of Russian internet giant Yandex through its Amsterdam-based parent company.
In July, a Russian consortium finalized a $5.4 billion deal to acquire the Russia-based assets of Yandex, a move that marked the largest corporate exit since the invasion.

""We are pleased to have our shares trading again on Nasdaq, which opens a new chapter for our company as a publicly traded pure play in the fast-growing AI infrastructure space,"" Nebius CEO Arkady Volozh said.
Other Russian companies were suspended and ultimately delisted from Nasdaq, but Nebius maintained a suspended listing during months of negotiations to secure an exit from Russia, provided it could decouple from Yandex.

Many of the same Western shareholders have stakes in Nebius, but the company has undergone a significant transformation.
Once valued at over $30 billion as Russia's equivalent of Google, Nebius is now a fledgling European tech company focused on AI infrastructure, cloud services, and self-driving technology.
AI-FOCUSED

With its Russian ties severed, Nebius is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the burgeoning AI market, founder and CEO Arkady Volozh told Reuters in July. Nebius plans to invest more than $1 billion by mid-2025.b

""Our ambition is to build one of the world's largest specialist AI infrastructure businesses. This requires access to technological expertise, graphics processing units (""GPUs"") and capital. These are exactly what we have"", Volozh said.
Nebius had annualized run-rate revenue of $120 million as of September 30, 2024, and it expects to be on track for $170 million to $190 million in annualized run-rate revenue by year end 2024, the statement said.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

"Large cap tech, Nvidia, and by extension US index funds are likely to crash, small cap value/international to outperform. Here's why",1g6ahuv,skilliard7,2024-10-18 10:33:01,0,0.33,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g6ahuv/large_cap_tech_nvidia_and_by_extension_us_index/,"If you look at the story of how the S&P500 has performed so well over the past decade, the answer is high return on invested capital from tech companies. By hiring top engineers to build innovative products, and scaling the product globally, these companies to achieved rapid growth at little cost, resulting in impressive returns to shareholders. Historically, hardware costs were very cheap to scale compared to the revenue it brings in. You could spend a few thousand per month in hosting costs, and bring in millions in profits.

However, this is changing. 7 out of 10 of the top holdings in the S&P500 are gambling huge on AI- they have laid off tens of thousands of the talented engineers that drove their earnings growth, in order to fund expensive acquisitions of AI hardware(Not counting Nvidia because they are the ones profiting from it).

Tech can no longer be seen as an industry with low capital costs, because AI is tremendously expensive to deploy and maintain. For example, Microsoft expects to spend $100 Billion on AI datacenters through Fiscal 2027. That's 40% more than their entire profit in 2023. Because AI hardware is so expensive, and the electricity usage is so tremendous, these future applications are no longer cheap to deploy and maintain.

ChatGPT is perhaps the best example of this. Despite being tremendously successful from a growth perspective, it has been tremendously unprofitable from an operating standpoint, and relies on continued bailouts from large companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Softbank to stay afloat. 

The economics of tech companies is quickly changing; with companies in an arms race to acquire as many Nvidia chips as possible to build the best GenAI applications, they are hurting their margins and operating profitability.

The impact of these investments has been quite lousy so far; other than some round tripping transactions to create fake revenue and balance sheet growth, these ai investments, while tremendously expensive, have not paid off:

- Microsoft's CoPilot has been a complete failure, consumers are not buying CoPilot pcs, and the CoPilot app has a 2.3 star rating on the Windows store. They are also facing regulatory pressure in Europe over Recall.

- Google's AI is providing dangerous and potentially deadly misinformation to users of its search engine, such as incorrect advice about prescriptions.

- Amazon's ""Go"" stores were supposed to use ML/AI to handle checkouts, when in reality, the AI failed to handle most of the work, and the remainder was just outsourced to human operators in India which struggled to keep up with the workload.

- Tesla has still failed to implement full self driving, and during its robotaxi event, had human actors control the robots to fake them being AI controlled.

- Google's Waymo is very impressive from a technology standpoint, but its hardware costs and regulatory barriers make it unlikely to achieve profitability, even as it expands.

Despite the poor results of AI investments so far, all of the top 10 holdings in the S&P500 other than Berkshire Hathaway trade at very high P/E Ratio, suggesting that very high earnings growth is priced in.

Even if AI will have a significant impact on the economy and society, the economics of it are not favorable to investors due to the high capex costs involved. Tech is no longer an industry where a team of 10-20 engineers can build a product that brings in Billions in revenue, with minimal hosting costs. It is now an industry where Billions of capital expenditures are needed just to build a model, and margins on the finished product are very poor.

Of course, tech CEOs realize this; which is why Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google are all working to replace Nvidia hardware, which sells at a huge markup, with their own in house chips. This is a tremendous threat to Nvidia's long term prospects.

Given the high expectations implied by elevated price to earnings ratios, and the poor financial performance of AI applications, it does seem quite unlikely that large caps will continue to outperform.

Small cap value and international stocks are almost certainly a better investment; if AI does drive significant productivity improvements, then labor heavy businesses will benefit from improved margins from using these products that large tech companies are offering.

Looking at small cap value funds like AVUV, and international stock indexes, there are a tremendous amount of labor intensive businesses with low margins in these funds that would benefit from AI/ML. Net margins going from 3% to 10% due to improved productivity would mean earnings more than tripling.

This has historically been the case with technical revolutions. For example, railroads revolutionized our economy and drove tremendous economic growth, but they provided terrible returns to shareholders.",2024-10-18,0.9872,Positive,"['AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'ML', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AVUV', 'AI', 'ML']"

"Intel seeks billions for minority stake in Altera business, sources say",1g66y0u,Puginator,2024-10-18 07:06:49,61,0.91,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g66y0u/intel_seeks_billions_for_minority_stake_in_altera/,"Intel is looking to sell at least a minority stake in its Altera subsidiary that would raise several billion dollars in cash for the struggling firm, according to people familiar with the matter. This move that would represent a sharp about face from its earlier public messaging about the larger company’s prospects.

The storied semiconductor firm has made overtures to a number of private equity and strategic investors this week, said the people, who requested anonymity to speak freely about confidential information. Intel has expressed to some of those investors that it would be possible to acquire a majority stake in the Altera business, which was valued at $16.7 billion when Intel acquired it in 2015, said one of the people.

Intel is looking for a deal that values Altera at around $17 billion, said the people.

A representative for Intel did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. The sale process represents an abrupt about-face from Intel’s prior commentary on Altera, where as recently September its CEO said that Intel’s leadership considered the business to be a core part of Intel’s future.

Intel has previously said that it could look to monetize its Altera business via an initial public offering, possibly as soon as 2026. But the idea of taking strategic or private equity investment would be a marked acceleration of those plans.

CEO Pat Gelsinger and his leadership team have previously said that Intel understands its disadvantaged position and is working aggressively to remedy it. To be sure, the sale of a minority stake in Altera would allow Intel to more easily pursue its semiconductor fabrication ambitions and assuage investors that it has a strong path forward as an independent company.

But the sale process also comes as Qualcomm has expressed interest in acquiring its onetime rival, a deal which would face fierce regulatory scrutiny and reshape semiconductor industry. Intel has to grapple with a significant debt load, and has seen its stock plunge more than 50% year-to-date.

The move was announced by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, who said in a blog post on Thursday that Raghavan will be moving into the role of chief technologist after 12 years of leading teams across the search company. Raghavan will continue to report to Pichai in the new role, the company told CNBC in a statement.

“Prabhakar has decided it’s time to make a big leap in his own career,” Pichai wrote in the post. “In this role, he’ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.”

The move comes as Google continues to restructure its teams to move more quickly in the artificial intelligence arms race, where it faces increased competition. The company is also dealing with several antitrust lawsuits related to its search and ads business.

Fox has long been a member of Raghavan’s leadership team. He will be leading Google’s Knowledge and Information division, which includes the company’s search, ads and commerce products, Pichai said.

A Google employee since 2003, Fox has been vice president for product and design for the company’s Assistant product in recent years. He previously worked within the company’s ads business unit.

“Over the past few years, Nick has been instrumental in shaping Google’s AI product roadmap and collaborating closely with Prabhakar,” Pichai wrote.

Raghavan led the knowledge and information unit since 2018. Earlier this year, he told employees to prepare for a different market reality because “things are not like they were 15-20 years ago,” CNBC reported.

Additionally, Pichai announced that the team working on Google’s Gemini app, which includes Google’s AI direct-to-consumer products, will join Google DeepMind under AI head Demis Hassabis.

“Bringing the teams closer together will improve feedback loops, enable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app,” Pichai wrote.

The move also means the Assistant teams focused on devices and home experiences will move to the Platforms and Devices unit “so they can sit closer to the product surfaces they’re building for,” Pichai wrote.

Would you consider buying some European (mainly Dutch, Danish and so) stocks in order to reduce your exposure to a potential heavy drop in American stocks?

Uber has discussed a bid for travel booking company Expedia,1g5trq2,Puginator,2024-10-17 21:07:45,99,0.9,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g5trq2/uber_has_discussed_a_bid_for_travel_booking/,"Uber discussed a bid for travel booking company Expedia, CNBC confirmed, in a deal that would push the ride-share company into new markets beyond car travel and food delivery.

The talks were in early stages, according to a person familiar with the discussions who asked not to be named since the talks are confidential. It remains unclear if an acquisition will take place. Expedia is familiar territory for Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who previously served as CEO of the travel group from 2005 to 2017. Khosrowshahi is still a non-executive member of Expedia’s board.

Uber has a market cap of around $168 billion, greater than its pandemic peak of around $112 billion, when customers were trapped indoors and relied on food deliveries. Shares fell in 2022 as the company struggled with high gas prices, inflation and bringing more drivers back to the platform. Its target, Expedia, is worth around $20 billion.

Uber’s interest in Expedia was first reported by the Financial Times.

Shares of Expedia were up more than 6% Thursday morning.

Expedia users can book flights, lodging, cars and activities through the company’s website, and it owns additional travel sites like Hotels.com, Vrbo and Orbitz. Expedia reported $28.8 billion total gross bookings in its second-quarter results in August.

An acquisition of Expedia would be a ”’major strategic home run” for Uber, Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing partner, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Thursday. He said this suggests Uber is going on offense and looking for new monitization opportunities, and it could be a step toward a “super app.”

“They have a massive mojo, and they’re just gaining more and more share,” Ives said. “I think they’re going to be on the hunt for M&A.”

AGBA was previously trading as a penny stock from Hong Kong, which saw huge gains after the announcement of the merger, reaching at multiple points roughly twice the PPS that it was at before the recent string of good news (the lowest since April still being an order of magnitude above it's PPS prior to the initial announcement). As a Chinese stock, it's value was mainly propped up by the merger. **AGBA is now domesticating and moving it's headquarters to the USA in Delaware, and as a result is no longer a Chinese company.**

Triller was a private American corporation holding assets such as the **Triller app** (very similar concept to TikTok), Triller TV (a streaming service focused mainly on combat sports), and perhaps most valuable right now, is their majority stake in the **American Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship** (**BKFC**). Based in Philadelphia and founded in 2018, BKFC is the first promotion to hold an official state-sanctioned and commissioned bare-knuckle boxing event in the United States since 1889. **Partly owned by** **Conor McGregor** as of April 2024, it's often claimed to be ""the fastest-growing combat sport in the world"".

Previous AGBA shareholders received a 30% stake in the combined company, while Triller private investors received the other 70%. Importantly, **there is a 165 day lock-up where that 70% of the outstanding shares cannot be traded.** Furthermore, the stated valuation of the combined company according to the merger agreement is **$4 Billion USD (\~$30 per share) - around eight times it's current value if it is to be believed**.

There is a ""strategic partnership"" between the merged Triller company and Yorkville (YA II PN, LTD), which will come into effect very soon, the terms of which are shown in this 8-K [here](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001769624/000121390024059262/ea0208930-8k_agba.htm). Yorkville has control of a great deal of shares in the form of convertible debt. This will cause dilution, but it is also suspected that they are planning to leverage their power over the stock price to help pump it up significantly in order to get their money's worth and then some. They have not received any shares yet to my understanding, and are likely still holding down the stock's value to get an ideal entry point for at least a few days post-merger. It's not known with certainty, but it's suspected that Yorkville holds a very large short position on this stock, in part to keep the value down for their entry price, but potentially to also manipulate the value upwards after they buy-in by closing those short positions. This would offset the effect of dilution that their sales would have, and if timed right, may even trigger short squeezing and retail FOMO.

There has also been a great deal of hype regarding a **likely TikTok ban** which may come into effect in **mid-January**. The Triller app being a potential alternative to TikTok based in the USA puts it in a good position for massive growth following such a ban, especially if it can be improved using the combined assets of these merged companies. **Barring any delays, this catalyst would take place within the 165 day lock-up window of 70% of this stock's outstanding shares.**

The combination of these factors could spell out a very significant rally for $ILLR in the near future.

I'm currently holding 746 shares at a $4.95 average. My position has been at a 20-30% profit multiple times within the past couple weeks leading to the merger.

*Global chip stocks fell on Wednesday, after Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML posted disappointing sales forecasts, driving down global stocks in the sector.Shares of ASML extended losses into the second day at the start of the European trading session, down 5%. The company’s stock dropped 16% Tuesday, losing 49.2 billion euros ($53.6 billion) from its market capitalization in a single day, according to CNBC calculations.ASML’s decline also dragged other European semiconductor firms in the red on Wednesday. ASMI — a Netherlands-based firm that supplies wafer processing equipment for the semiconductor manufacturing industry — fell 2.3%. Compatriot chip equipment maker BE Semionductor dropped 1.9%.Dutch-listed semiconductor firm STMicroelectronics lost 1.2%, while German chipmaker Infineon shed 1.1%. Soitec, French semiconductor materials manufacturer, fell 0.9%*

&#x200B;

*Asian declines*

&#x200B;

*In Asia, meanwhile, shares of Japanese semiconductor manufacturing firm Tokyo Electron logged the biggest loses, dropping nearly 10%. Renesas Electronics fell over 3%, and Advantest, a testing equipment supplier dipped 0.8%.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Hon Hai Precision Industry — known internationally as Foxconn — fell as much as 3.3% and 1.6, respectively.South Korean chipmaking heavyweight SK Hynix, which manufactures high bandwidth memory chips for AI applications for Nvidia, traded 1.6% lower. While Samsung Electronics, the world’s largest maker for dynamic random-access memory chips, saw its shares drop 1.9%.Losses in the region’s semiconductor sector also dragged down major indexes. Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost more than 2%, South Korea’s Kospi dipped 0.6% and the Taiwan Weighted Index slid 0.7%.*

&#x200B;

*ASML reports early*

&#x200B;

*In a report on Tuesday, ASML, which is based in Veldhoven, Netherlands, said it expects net sales for 2025 to come in between 30 billion euros and 35 billion euros ($32.7 billion and $38.1 billion), at the lower half of the range it had previously provided.Net bookings for the September quarter were 2.6 billion euros ($2.83 billion), the company said — well below the 5.6 billion euro LSEG consensus estimate. Net sales, however, beat expectations coming in at 7.5 billion euros.The company’s CEO warned of cautiousness among customers and said a “recovery is more gradual than previously expected.”After ASML tanked 16%, other global chipmakers plunged. Nvidia fell 4.7% and AMD lost 5.2%.Also on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that that Biden administration officials had discussed limiting sales of advanced AI clips from Nvidia to certain countries in the interest of national security, further dampening investor sentiment around the semiconductor sector.ASML has faced a tougher business outlook in China due to U.S. and Dutch export restrictions on its shipments.CFO Roger Dassen said Tuesday that he expects the company’s China business to show a “more normalized percentage in our order book and also in our business.”“So we expect China to come in at around 20% of our total revenue for next year,” he said. In its June-quarter earnings presentation, ASML said that 49% of its sales come from China.ASML’s business in Asia is likely to face continued headwinds, Eugene, Hsiao, head of China equity strategy at Macquarie Capital, said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia” on Wednesday.While “it makes a lot of sense” for ASML to continue working with China from the “economic perspective”, he said, there are “broader issues between governments going into economic problems.”*",2024-10-16,-0.9468,Negative,"['ASML', 'ASML', 'ASML', 'ASML', 'CEO', 'ASML', 'ASML', 'CNBC', 'ASML', 'ASMI', 'BE', 'SK', 'AI', 'ASML', 'ASML', 'LSEG', 'CEO', 'ASML', 'AMD', 'AI', 'ASML', 'CFO', 'ASML', 'ASML', 'CNBC', 'ASML']"

"United Airlines plans $1.5 billion share buyback, beats estimates for Q3",1g52gmp,Puginator,2024-10-16 21:14:03,148,0.96,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g52gmp/united_airlines_plans_15_billion_share_buyback/,"United Airlines said Tuesday that it is starting a $1.5 billion share buyback as the carrier reported higher-than-expected earnings for the busy summer travel season and forecast strong results for the last three months of the year.

Shares of the airline were up roughly 9% in morning trading Wednesday, heading for their highest close since February 2020, before Covid-19 was declared a pandemic.

United expects to earn an adjusted $2.50 to $3.00 a share in the fourth quarter, compared to $2.00 a share a year earlier and the $2.68 analysts polled by LSEG estimated.

Here is what United reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on average estimates compiled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $3.33 adjusted vs. $3.17 expected

Revenue: $14.84 billion vs. $14.78 billion expected

The share buyback would be United’s first since before the Covid-19 pandemic. U.S. airlines received more than $50 billion in government aid during the pandemic travel slump that prohibited share repurchases and dividends, though airlines were still fighting for financial stability.

Southwest Airlines announced a $2.5 billion share repurchase program last month.

“Like other leading airlines and companies, we are initiating a measured, strategic share repurchase program,” United CEO Scott Kirby said in a note to staff on Tuesday. “Importantly, my commitment to you is that investing in our people and our business will always be my top priority even while we institute this share repurchase program.”

For the third quarter, United posted revenue of $14.84 billion, up 2.5% from a year earlier and above analysts’ estimates. It reported net income of $965 million, down 15% from a year ago.

United said domestic unit revenue was positive in August and September compared to last year as airlines trimmed a glut of flights that were pushing down fares. United expanded capacity by 4.1% in the third quarter. The carrier said corporate revenue rose 13% in the quarter; premium revenue, including business class tickets, rose 5%; and sales from its no-frills basic economy tickets were up 20%.

The airline last week unveiled a far-flung expansion for next year that included new flights to Mongolia, Senegal, Spain and Greenland in a chase for international travel demand.

Adjusting for one-time items, United reported earnings per share of $3.33, topping Wall Street forecasts and United’s estimate in July of $2.75 to $3.25 a share.

Airline executives will hold a call with analysts at 10:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday and will likely face questions about demand for the end of the year and into 2025, as well as production problems at Boeing, where most factories have been idled during a more than monthlong machinist strike.

United’s flight attendants’ union, which hasn’t yet reached a new labor agreement with the company slammed the airline’s decision to resume buybacks.

In a statement, Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents crews at United, Spirit, Alaska and other carriers, said: “That money United just promised Wall Street belongs to Flight Attendants who worked throughout the pandemic and during this taxing recovery for all of us on the frontlines.”

1. When selling RSUs I receive through my place of employment, how does the taxation work? Is it a simple capital gains tax on the increase of value since the day it officially vested or from the day I was awarded them and then made to sit through a vesting cycle? For example: I was awarded 55 RSUs in September of 2021 but they didn't vest, and enter my portfolio, until May 2022, Would those gains be from the September 2021 or May 2022?

  
2. If you sell multiple shares of stock and some have been yours for over a year and some not, are long term and short term capital gains taxes figured for each unit sold or is it a package deal? Are you able to choose which ones to sell individually or does it automatically choose FIFO or the opposite?

"Amazon goes nuclear, to invest more than $500 million to develop small modular reactors",1g4zenu,_hiddenscout,2024-10-16 18:59:23,1182,0.98,227,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g4zenu/amazon_goes_nuclear_to_invest_more_than_500/,"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/10/16/amazon-goes-nuclear-investing-more-than-500-million-to-develop-small-module-reactors.html

Amazon Web Services is investing over $500 million in nuclear power, announcing three projects from Virginia to Washington State. AWS, Amazon's subsidiary in cloud computing, has a massive and increasing need for clean energy as it expands its services into generative AI. It's also a part of Amazon's path to net-zero carbon emissions.

AWS announced it has signed an agreement with Dominion Energy, Virginia's utility company, to explore the development of a small modular nuclear reactor, or SMR, near Dominion's existing North Anna nuclear power station. Nuclear reactors produce no carbon emissions.

An SMR is an advanced type of nuclear reactor with a smaller footprint that allows it to be built closer to the grid. They also have faster build times than traditional reactors, allowing them to come online sooner.

Amazon is the latest large tech company to buy into nuclear power to fuel the growing demands from data centers. Earlier this week, Google announced it will purchase power from SMR developer Kairos Power. Constellation Energy is restarting Three Mile Island to power Microsoft data centers.

""We see the need for gigawatts of power in the coming years, and there's not going to be enough wind and solar projects to be able to meet the needs, and so nuclear is a great opportunity,"" said Matthew Garman, CEO of AWS. ""Also, the technology is really advancing to a place with SMRs where there's going to be a new technology that's going to be safe and that's going to be easy to manufacture in a much smaller form.""

Virginia is home to nearly half of all the data centers in the U.S., with one area in Northern Virginia dubbed Data Center Alley, the bulk of which is in Loudon County. An estimated 70% of the world's internet traffic travels through Data Center Alley each day.

Dominion serves roughly 3,500 megawatts from 452 data centers across its service territory in Virginia. About 70% is in Data Center Alley. A single data center typically demands about 30 megawatts or greater, according to Dominion Energy. Bob Blue, its president and CEO, said in a recent quarterly earnings call that the utility now receives individual requests for 60 megawatts to 90 megawatts or greater. Dominion projects that power demand will increase by 85% over the next 15 years. AWS expects the new SMRs to bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the Virginia region.

""Small modular nuclear reactors will play a critical role in positioning Virginia as a leading nuclear innovation hub,"" said Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a release. ""Amazon Web Services' commitment to this technology and their partnership with Dominion is a significant step forward to meet the future power needs of a growing Virginia.""

AWS plans to invest $35 billion by 2040 to establish multiple data center campuses across Virginia, according to an announcement from Youngkin last year.

""These SMRs will be powering directly into the grid, so they'll go to power everything, part of that is the data centers, but everything that is plugged into the grid will benefit,"" Garman added.

Amazon also announced a new agreement with utility company Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, to fund the development, licensing and construction of four SMRs in Washington State. The reactors will be built, owned and operated by Energy Northwest but will provide energy directly to the grid, which will also help power Amazon operations.

Under the agreement, Amazon will have the right to purchase electricity from the first four modules. Energy Northwest has the option to build up to eight additional modules. That power would also be available to Amazon and Northwest utilities to power homes and businesses.

The SMRs will be developed with technology from Maryland-based X-energy, a developer of SMRs and fuel. Along with Amazon's other announcements, Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund disclosed it is the lead anchor in a $500 million financing round for X-Energy. The Climate Pledge Fund is its corporate venture capital fund that invests in early-stage sustainability companies. Other investors include Citadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin, affiliates of Ares Management Corporation, NGP and the University of Michigan.

""Amazon and X-energy are poised to define the future of advanced nuclear energy in the commercial marketplace,"" said X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell. ""To fully realize the opportunities available through artificial intelligence, we must bring clean, safe, and reliable electrons onto the grid with proven technologies that can scale and grow with demand.""

Last spring, AWS invested in a nuclear energy project with Talen Energy, signing an agreement to purchase nuclear power from the company's existing Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, a nuclear power station in Salem Township, Pennsylvania. AWS also purchased the adjacent, nuclear-powered data center campus from Talen for $650 million.

Qualcomm Said to Wait for US Election to Decide Intel Move,1g4nr8y,JRshoe1997,2024-10-16 06:48:31,188,0.94,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g4nr8y/qualcomm_said_to_wait_for_us_election_to_decide/,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) is likely to wait until after the US presidential election in November before deciding whether to pursue an offer to buy Intel Corp. (INTC), people familiar with the matter said.

San Diego-based Qualcomm wants greater clarity on the new occupant of the White House before deciding its next move because of the impact any future administration would have on the antitrust landscape and America’s relationship with China, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.

Qualcomm could opt to wait until after the inauguration of the new US president in January before deciding how to proceed, given the many complexities of a potential transaction involving Intel, some of the people said.

A combination of Qualcomm and Intel, whose products are key to the digital framework supporting everyday life — from smartphones to electric vehicles — would almost certainly draw intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in the US and around the world. That includes China, a key market for both Qualcomm and Intel.

Qualcomm made a preliminary approach to Intel on a possible takeover of its struggling rival in September. In the same month, the company made informal inquiries with antitrust regulators in China to gauge their stance on any potential deal, some of the people said. Qualcomm hasn’t received any feedback from Chinese authorities, which are waiting to see if the company actually makes a formal bid, they said.

Intel is at the heart of the US government’s plan for a homegrown chipmaking renaissance, making the political backing for any deal crucial. The Biden administration has consistently framed the importance of its chipmaking policy in national security terms. Intel is in line to get the biggest allocation of funding under the 2022 Chips and Science Act, if it goes ahead with all of its factory building plans. Qualcomm has been speaking with US regulators and believes an all-American combination could allay any concerns, people familiar with the matter have previously said.

Making a bid after the election may bring other advantages for Qualcomm. Intel will report third-quarter earnings later this month. If that follows the pattern of the disappointing announcement of three months ago and the impact it had on the potential target’s stock price, it could make a deal considerably less expensive for Qualcomm. This time around, analysts are predicting another net loss in excess of $1 billion for Intel.

Qualcomm’s deliberations are ongoing and there’s no certainty that the company will decide to pursue an offer for Intel and the timing could change, the people said. Representatives for Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment, while the State Administration for Market Regulation in China didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, Intel has been working on an expensive plan to remake itself and bring in new products, technology and outside customers. As part of a recently announced shakeup, Intel intends to turn its programmable chip division into a standalone business and sell shares to the public or seek an investor for it.

Apollo Global Management Inc. has offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Intel, Bloomberg News reported last month, providing the chipmaker with a vote of confidence in its turnaround strategy and a possible alternative to any takeover by Qualcomm.

[Boeing](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BA) [BA -](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BA) is moving to raise at least $10 billion by selling new shares in a bid to stabilize its increasingly precarious finances.

The jet maker, in a pair of regulatory filings on Tuesday, told investors it could issue up to $25 billion in shares or debt during the next three years while also entering into a new credit agreement with lenders.

Under the shelf registration, Boeing is expected to pursue a stock offering that raises around $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

A [strike by Boeing’s largest union](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/boeing-strike-workers-reasons-explained-589c245e?mod=article_inline) is exacerbating financial woes at the jet maker, which last turned a profit in 2018. Its operations had been burning through about $1 billion a month before the strike.

Boeing ended September with $10.3 billion in cash and securities, close to the minimum amount the company has said it needs to operate. 

The new $10 billion credit agreement is in addition to about $10 billion in existing, untapped revolving credit agreements. Boeing has $45 billion in net debt.

“These are two prudent steps to support the company’s access to liquidity,” Boeing said in a statement. Boeing shares, which began the year around $250, were little changed in premarket trading near $150.

Google to buy nuclear power for AI datacentres in ‘world first’ deal,1g47oik,_hiddenscout,2024-10-15 18:56:45,526,0.96,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g47oik/google_to_buy_nuclear_power_for_ai_datacentres_in/,"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/15/google-buy-nuclear-power-ai-datacentres-kairos-power

Google has signed a “world first” deal to buy energy from a fleet of mini nuclear reactors to generate the power needed for the rise in use of artificial intelligence.

The US tech corporation has ordered six or seven small nuclear reactors (SMRs) from California’s Kairos Power, with the first due to be completed by 2030 and the remainder by 2035.

Google hopes the deal will provide a low-carbon solution to power datacentres, which require huge volumes of electricity.

The US company, owned by Alphabet, said nuclear provided “a clean, round-the-clock power source that can help us reliably meet electricity demands”.

The explosive growth of generative AI, as well as cloud storage, has increased tech companies’ electricity demands.

Last month, Microsoft struck a deal to take energy from Three Mile Island, activating the plant for the first time in five years. The site, in Pennsylvania, was the location of the most serious nuclear meltdown in US history, in March 1979. Amazon bought a datacentre powered by nuclear energy in March from Talen Energy.

The locations of the new plants and financial details of the agreement were not revealed. Google has agreed to buy a total of 500 megawatts of power from Kairos, which was founded in 2016 and is building a demonstration reactor in Tennessee, due to be completed in 2027.

Michael Terrell, the senior director for energy and climate at Google, said: “The grid needs new electricity sources to support AI technologies that are powering major scientific advances, improving services for businesses and customers, and driving national competitiveness and economic growth.

“This agreement helps accelerate a new technology to meet energy needs cleanly and reliably, and unlock the full potential of AI for everyone.”

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Nvidia closes at record as AI chipmaker's market cap tops $3.4 trillion,1g3pofm,Puginator,2024-10-15 01:49:59,916,0.95,241,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g3pofm/nvidia_closes_at_record_as_ai_chipmakers_market/,"Nvidia shares closed at a record on Monday as Wall Street gears up for earnings season and updates from all of the chipmaker’s top customers on their planned spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.

The stock climbed 2.4% to close at $138.07, topping its prior high of $135.58 on June 18. The shares are now up almost 180% for the year and have soared more than nine-fold since the beginning of 2023.

Nvidia, widely viewed as the company selling the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, has been the biggest beneficiary of the generative AI boom, which started with the public release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to create and deploy advanced AI models that power ChatGPT and similar applications.

Companies including Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia GPUs in large quantities to build increasingly large clusters of computers for their advanced AI work. Those companies are all slated to report quarterly results by the end of October.

Of the billions of dollars the top tech companies are spending annually on their AI buildouts, an outsized amount is going to Nvidia, which controls about 95% of the market for AI training and inference chips, according to analysts at Mizuho.

Nvidia’s revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, and at least tripled in three of those periods. Growth is expected to modestly slow the rest of the year, with analysts projecting expansion of about 82% to $32.9 billion in the quarter ending in October, according to LSEG.

Nvidia recently said that demand for its next-generation AI GPU called Blackwell is “insane” and it expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter.

With a market cap of $3.4 trillion, Nvidia is the second most valuable publicly traded U.S. company, behind Apple at about $3.55 trillion.

**The Federal Reserve may have pretty much just hit its 2% inflation target**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/11/the-federal-reserve-may-have-pretty-much-just-hit-its-2percent-inflation-target.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/11/the-federal-reserve-may-have-pretty-much-just-hit-its-2percent-inflation-target.html)

*Key Points*

* *This week’s inflation data provided more evidence that the Federal Reserve is nearing its 2% objective, a mark that Goldman Sachs thinks the central bank may have already hit.*
* *From a policy standpoint, lower inflation opens the door for the Fed to keep cutting interest rates.*

&#x200B;

*This week’s inflation data provided more evidence that the Federal Reserve is nearing its objective, fresh on the heels of the central bank’s dramatic interest rate cut just a few weeks ago.*

*Consumer and producer price indexes for September both came in around expectations, showing that inflation is drifting down to the central bank’s 2% target.*

*In fact, economists at Goldman Sachs think the Fed may already be there.*

*The Wall Street investment bank Friday projected that the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures price index for September will show a 12-month inflation rate of 2.04% when it is released later this month.*

*If Goldman is correct, that number would get rounded down to 2% and be right in line with the Fed’s long-held objective, a little over two years after inflation spiked to a 40-year high and unleashed an aggressive round of interest rate hikes. The Fed prefers the PCE as its inflation gauge though it uses a variety of inputs to make decisions.*

*“The overall trend over 12, 18 months is clearly that inflation has come down a lot, and the job market has cooled to a level which is around where we think full employment is,” Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said in a CNBC interview Thursday after the latest consumer price data was released. “We’d like to get both of them to stay in the space where they are right now.”*

&#x200B;

*Some obstacles ahead*

&#x200B;

*While keeping inflation at bay may not be an easy task, the latest data indicates that though prices are not receding from their troublesome heights of a few years ago, the rate at which they are increasing is pulling back.*

*The 12-month rate for the all-items consumer price index was at 2.4% in September, while the producer price index, a proxy for wholesale inflation and a leading gauge for pipeline pressures, showed an annual rate of 1.8%.*

*Goldman’s projection that the PCE index is heading to 2% is also about in line with tracking from the Cleveland Fed.*

*The central bank district’s “inflation nowcasting” dashboard pegs the 12-month headline PCE rate at 2.06% for September, which would get rounded up to 2.1%. However, on an annualized pace, inflation for the entire third quarter is running at just a 1.4% rate — well below the Fed’s 2% goal.*

*To be sure, there are some caveats to show that policymakers still have some work to do.*

*Core inflation, which excludes food and energy and is a metric that the Fed considers a better measure of longer-term trends, is expected to run at a 2.6% annual rate for the PCE in September, according to Goldman. Using just the consumer price index, core inflation was even worse in September, at 3.3%.*

*Fed officials, though, see the unexpectedly high shelter inflation numbers as a major driver of the core measure, which they figure will ease as a lower trend in rents works its way through the data.*

*Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Sept. 30, addressing the rent situation, said he expects housing inflation to continue to recede while “broader economic conditions also set the table for further disinflation.”*

*From a policy standpoint, lower inflation opens the door for the Fed to keep cutting rates, particularly as it turns its attention to the labor market, though there’s some trepidation about how quickly it should move.*

*September’s half percentage point reduction to a fed funds range of 4.75% to 5% was unprecedented for an economy in expansion, and the Fed at the very least is expected to return to its normal quarter-point pace. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic even said Thursday he’d be open to skipping a move altogether at the November meeting.*

*“Aggressive easing would risk spiking consumer demand just as it is settling into a sustainable pace,” PNC senior economist Kurt Rankin said in a post-PPI analysis. “This result would in turn put pressure on businesses to meet that demand, re-igniting gains in those businesses’ own costs as they jockey for the necessary resources to do so.”*

*Futures traders are betting on a near certainty that the Fed cuts rates by a quarter point at both the November and December meetings.*",2024-10-13,0.8399,Positive,"['PCE', 'CNBC', 'PCE', 'PCE', 'PCE', 'PNC', 'PPI']"

"Ride-sharing giants Uber, Lyft jump after Tesla’s ‘toothless taxi’ fails to excite investors",1g221z2,Sotarif,2024-10-12 20:33:00,328,0.92,101,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g221z2/ridesharing_giants_uber_lyft_jump_after_teslas/,"Tesla’s hyped robotaxi unveiling posed a threat to Uber’s ride-sharing aspirations, but it has turned into a boon for the stock instead.

Uber shares had been falling on the initial investor excitement leading up to Thursday’s event — particularly slumping in early August and mid-September — but surged more than 9% on Friday on renewed enthusiasm that the company is well positioned to advance its autonomous vehicle offerings. The move pushed the stock to a 52-week high and it was leading the S&P 500 higher during the session.

That is a massive turnaround for Uber’s stock, which is now up nearly 22% over the past month and about 38% for the year. Lyft, another major player, is also surging about 10% on Friday. By comparison, Tesla’s shares are plunging during Friday’s trading session and are down more than 11% this year, vastly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, which have each gained around 22% so far this year.

The buzz around Tesla’s highly anticipated cybercab has largely dissipated due to a lack of detail on its latest full self-driving technology advancements and the company’s failure to provide insight on its ride-sharing service strategy or economics, among other expectations investors had.

“TSLA’s toothless taxi is a best-case outcome for UBER,” Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said in a Friday note, noting that the electric car maker provided ambitious targets but little signs of feasibility.

I wonder who bought all those stocks at the time of the fire sale. It sure weren't the russians themselves (retail or companies), it must have been US (or western in general) hedge funds. I know for a fact that this has happened with their eurobonds in general.

Moving from VOO to VUSA ,1g1k7gj,dantheman2108,2024-10-12 02:40:28,1,0.52,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g1k7gj/moving_from_voo_to_vusa/,"Hi everyone, hope you're all doing well!

Posting this just to see if my train of though is wrong and really just to ask a question. Before I get to my question, some context. I'm 25 years old and reside in a European country that uses Euro as its main currency. I currently have just under $40K in VOO which makes up 50% of my portfolio. The other 50% is in individual stocks.

So I've been investing in the S&P500 index for the past 6 years or so through VOO and have only recently come across VUSA. The main feature that attracted me to VUSA, is the fact that I will not need to exchange my euros to dollars in order to invest in the S&P500. With the way I currently invest in the S&P500 through VOO, I am exposed to fluctuations between the dollar and the euro, and I would much rather not have that added risk.

My question is, would it be a good decision to keep the current position I have in VOO and simply move the amount I invest in my portfolio every month to VUSA instead? My plan would be to continue to invest what I do monthly into VUSA instead of the VOO, and reinvest the dividends made from both funds into VUSA.

The reason I do not want to sell my VOO position and reinvest it in VUSA is because at this point in time, the S&P500 is at an all time high, and I would much rather not have my average cost be at the current highs the fund has hit and just start averaging in from now.

What do you think would be best to do in this situation?

Thanks in advance to anyone who comments!",2024-10-12,0.9189,Positive,"['VOO', 'VOO', 'VUSA', 'VUSA', 'VOO', 'VOO', 'VUSA', 'VUSA', 'VOO', 'VUSA', 'VOO', 'VUSA']"

Boeing expects to report a loss of an $9.97 a share in the third quarter, the company said in a surprise release on Friday. It took charges in both its commercial airplane unit and defense business.

The manufacturer also won’t deliver its still-uncertified 777X wide-body plane until 2026, putting it six years behind schedule, and will stop making commercial 767s in 2027, CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a staff memo on Friday afternoon.

“Our business is in a difficult position, and it is hard to overstate the challenges we face together,” Ortberg said. “Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term.”

The job and cost cuts are the most dramatic moves to date from Ortberg, who is just over two months into his tenure in the top job.

He was tasked with restoring Boeing after safety and manufacturing crises, but the labor strike has been the biggest challenge yet for Ortberg. Credit ratings agencies have warned the company is at risk of losing its investment-grade rating, and Boeing has been burning through cash in what company leaders hoped would be a turnaround year.

S&P Global Ratings said earlier this week that Boeing is losing more than $1 billion a month from the strike, which began Sept. 13 after machinists overwhelmingly voted down a tentative agreement the company reached with the union. Tensions have been rising between the manufacturer and the union, and Boeing withdrew a contract offer earlier this week.

Posted here awhile back about my probate attorney holding onto paper stock certificates  for over a year with no information obtained. Advice was to get the certs back, which I finally did, and fire him. I also did do that as well but for a reason outside of the paper stock certs and this issue was far more serious.

Now I am currently consulting with different attorneys for the rest of probate proceedings. It's going to be a bit of time to decide.

I found all the transfer agents for the paper stock certificates on my own and with your help, so thank you. I need to get account balance summaries for these, especially because the Inventory posted by the (now former) attorney doesn't include them. However, all the transfer agents require court papers dated within 90 days.

My domiciliary papers are from December of 2023.
In my state, domiciliary papers are only issued once and are not renewable.

Should I submit the packets to the transfer agents with my court papers as-is or should I wait to find a new attorney and have them go through the process of obtaining new domiciliary papers? I don't need anything other than valuation determinations at this time.

Scrutiny on single use plastics - is Ball Corporation (world's largest aluminum can maker) a play?,1g1fmjh,mmmoctopie,2024-10-11 23:15:53,25,0.79,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g1fmjh/scrutiny_on_single_use_plastics_is_ball/,"Hi all, had some thoughts I'd like to sanity check when considering buying into Ball Corporation, world's largest maker of aluminum cans, as there is more trend to avoiding plastics for both environmental and health reasons (IE Microplastics).

I'm noticing more and more the emergence of aluminum bottles for waters and the like in stores around me. Nothing revolutionary, but I definitely notice them more.

Here's an example:

* [https://www.nba.com/bulls/news/united-center-chicago-bulls-and-chicago-blackhawks-eliminate-all-single-use-plastic-water-bottles-with-culligan-international-as-the-new-official-water-partner](https://www.nba.com/bulls/news/united-center-chicago-bulls-and-chicago-blackhawks-eliminate-all-single-use-plastic-water-bottles-with-culligan-international-as-the-new-official-water-partner)

There is also some handwaving in the general direction of the problem of single use plastics by the US Government, including phasing out on federal property by the 2030's and elimination by 2040. Will it happen? Probably not, but the handwaving is there. 

For instance:

* [https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-phase-out-single-use-plastic-federal-operations-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-phase-out-single-use-plastic-federal-operations-2024-07-19/)

So I also note that Ball Corporation - who make these lovely mason jars I use every now and then for making tomato sauces and the like - are the world's largest manufacturer of Aluminum cans. So I suppose my question is, can they make more of them and will the company be a long-term play? 

* The make over 112 billion cans a year according to this Redditor [https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1b6orak/til\_that\_ball\_corp\_famous\_for\_its\_mason\_jars\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1b6orak/til_that_ball_corp_famous_for_its_mason_jars_is/)

There are a few other players in this space, but Ball is the one I hear the most about. They also were dabbling in Aerospace for a hot minute there, but they've sold out of that to focus on their core packaging business. 

I've only done a quick scan, the numbers don't look like lighting the world on fire right now, and they had a few revenue misses. But... I'm open to hopping in given the above.

Tesla is Completely out of Touch with Needs of Taxi Services. ,1g1e9q0,YungPersian,2024-10-11 22:15:39,776,0.8,432,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g1e9q0/tesla_is_completely_out_of_touch_with_needs_of/,"Seeing a lot of focus on the Temu Boston Dynamics bot, but not a lot of discussion on the robo taxi. 

How this thing is built tells me how out of touch and unprepared Tesla is to seriously compete in ride servicing. 

First off this thing has two seats, that alone is such a dumb design decision. It had to be Elon that said to keep it as two seats so it looks futuristic and aesthetic. What if I want to travel with a small group of people? I’m not using the LAX shuttle van at that point, I’m immediately turning to a competitor. Haven’t really seen anyone comment on how out of touch and unnecessary that was. 

One other concern I have is how Tesla primarily uses cameras. What if there are sirens and a fire truck, ambulance, or police car is blowing through an intersection. Other autonomous vehicles incorporate sound, I’m not too sure Tesla does. If not it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. 

Beyond this there’s the ridiculous price tag he put on it which it’ll probably be nowhere close to. 

What are other people’s thoughts on this, did anything with this Robotaxi actually look like a feasible product to you? It looks like an aesthetic toy, but not an actual product that can compete in the space. Based on my understanding of a typical car design cycle, redesigning this to add four instead of just 2 seats would take probably another 2-4 years at least. To me it seems like they really just showed they lost on their biggest bet in the near future. 


Edit: Alright read through the comments, and still think the 2 seat no steering wheel design is stupid. People are saying this is meant to also be a personal commuter car. So my choices are to buy a 30K Robotaxi (knowing Tesla’s history this WILL be priced higher) and then ALSO get a model 3 or model Y to drive around my family for ANOTHER 40K when I can just get ONE model 3 or any other self driving car, no Robotaxi and do everything I need? How is that budget friendly at all, and if there’s a nicer car with a steering wheel that self drives why would I buy something without the option of a steering wheel? 
Still a toy.
 
Also, if it’s for personal use, how does this know where to park at my office or how to get past a security gate to private property? If I live in a condo building with a garage how does it know how to get out of the parking garage and where my parking space is? It makes no sense as a personal car for a LOT of people.

And even if the majority of taxi rides are 1-2 people, why not just use a model 3 that’s 10K more, already exists, and can service that additional 15-20% of your taxi market (given the Robotaxi is definitely not gonna cost 30K and over the life of the car the extra seats pay for themselves). You also save on all the costs that it took to make a stupid 2 seater when it came to expanding production lines/capacity, testing, and designing the pointless thing. 

My opinion doesn’t change this thing shouldn’t exist, and it’s out of touch with what most people need. Total waste of time when they could’ve focused on actually competing with growing competition in the normal car space where they’re losing their competitive advantage. There’s a reason why Uber and the ex-Waymo CEO were not impressed.",2024-10-11,-0.9251,Negative,"['LAX', 'WILL', 'ALSO', 'ONE', 'LOT', 'CEO']"

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress",1g18fon,thelastsubject123,2024-10-11 17:49:27,1701,0.93,565,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g18fon/tesla_shares_drop_6_in_premarket_after_cybercab/,"Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.",2024-10-11,0.928,Positive,"['CEO', 'ET', 'FSD', 'FSD', 'AI', 'AV', 'FSD', 'AI', 'FSD', 'AI', 'FSD', 'TSLA']"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Morgan Stanley just met with Nvidia’s CEO and came away even more confident in its top pick,1g0qgfz,r2002,2024-10-11 00:34:51,251,0.9,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g0qgfz/morgan_stanley_just_met_with_nvidias_ceo_and_came/,"Source according to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/10/morgan-stanley-just-met-with-nvidias-ceo-and-came-away-even-more-confident-in-their-top-pick.html) ([archive](https://archive.ph/WQiAK)): 

* Nvidia remains at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation, with new opportunities to gain market share, Morgan Stanley said.

* Analyst Joseph Moore reiterated his overweight rating on the chipmaker and said meetings with Nvidia’s CEO and other management reinforced the firm’s view that it is the top pick in semiconductors. Morgan Stanley hosted the company for a three-day nondeal road show this week.

* “We remain very bullish longer term, but would concede given the rally that shorter-term upside from here raises the bar on earnings somewhat,” Moore said in a Thursday note to clients. His $150 price target implies about 13.1% potential upside for the stock, which has skyrocketed nearly 167% this year.

* “This is still an exceptional situation, with AI the most important trend in technology, and NVIDIA unquestionably the biggest beneficiary of those investments,” he said.

* Long-term confidence in Nvidia’s growth remains high, the analyst said. Management highlighted opportunities in evolving generative AI inference that will scale exponentially involving “long thinking” — or inference interactions that require substantially more computation. Moore explained that these tasks will require a “much richer mix of hardware” that will provide Nvidia with a new avenue for growth.

* “NVIDIA’s upcoming rack scale products as an optimal solution,” Moore said. “The longer term vision is that deep thinking will allow every company in the world to hire large numbers of ‘digital AI employees’ that can execute challenging tasks,” he added.

* According to Moore, Nvidia’s Blackwell systems NVL36/72 are the optimal solution for those challenges, as he believes they provide a more capable processor to the AI markets, with the GB200 systems potentially being the most important innovation as they have a “full rack” approach. Under that approach, Nvidia enables 36 or 72 GPU racks to simultaneously communicate with other graphics processing units, enhancing the ability to treat the entire rack as one massive system.

* “Our view continues to be that NVIDIA is likely to actually gain share of AI processors in 2025, as the biggest users of custom silicon are seeing very steep ramps with NVIDIA solutions next year,” Moore said.

* The analyst is also confident that the Blackwell rollout is on schedule, with orders booked out roughly 12 months, which also drives strong short-term demand for Nvidia’s Hopper GPU architecture.

* “In the shorter term, the Blackwell ramp appears to be quite strong, with no major changes to the roadmaps and every indication that business remains robust with very high forward visibility,” Moore said.",2024-10-11,0.9979,Positive,"['CNBC', 'CEO', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'GPU', 'AI', 'GPU']"

Su seemed to hint at that in her keynote presentation. “There’s no one company that has every answer,” she said, noting that AMD hopes to stand out in part through its embrace of open industry standards.

Companies need “the right compute for the right applications,” she said, adding that AMD has “the best portfolio in the industry to address end-to-end AI,” in her view.

Su opened by showing off the company’s new fifth-generation Epyc server central-processing unit for cloud, enterprise and AI use cases. The product, nicknamed Turin, offers up to four times more throughput performance.

Amin Vahdat, the vice president for machine learning, systems and cloud AI at Google, came onstage to discuss the product and praise the performance per watt with AMD offerings.",2024-10-10,0.986,Positive,"['AI', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AMD']"

The bank's U.S. unit is expected to plead guilty on Thursday to the charges, the report said on Wednesday.

TD Bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

As part of the agreement, the bank's primary U.S. regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), is also expected to impose an asset limit barring the Canadian lender from growing above a certain level in the country, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Both the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) are planning to put independent monitors in place to watch the lender closely and ensure compliance with the pacts, the report said.

The FinCEN monitor is expected to be in place for four years, the WSJ reported, citing one person familiar with the matter.

The settlement will include the DOJ, the FinCEN, OCC and the Federal Reserve among which the Justice Department will take the biggest slice of the penalties amounting to about $1.8 billion with the FinCEN getting $1.3 billion, the report said.

Spokespeople for the DOJ, the OCC and the FinCEN did not respond immediately to Reuters' requests for comment.

&#x200B;

*Federal Reserve officials at their September meeting agreed to cut interest rates but were unsure how aggressive to get, ultimately deciding on a half percentage point move in an effort to balance confidence on inflation with worries over the labor market, according to minutes released Wednesday.*

*The meeting summary detailed reasons that policymakers decided to approve a jumbo rate cut of 50 basis points for the first time in more than four years and showed members divided over the economic outlook.*

*Some officials hoped for a smaller, quarter percentage point cut as they sought assurance that inflation was moving sustainably lower and were less worried about the jobs picture.*

*Ultimately, only one Federal Open Market Committee member, Governor Michelle Bowman, voted against the half-point cut, saying she would have preferred a quarter point. But the minutes indicated that others also favored a smaller move. It was the first time a governor had dissented on an interest rate vote since 2005 for a Fed known for its unity on monetary policy.*

*“Some participants observed that they would have preferred a 25 basis point reduction of the target range at this meeting, and a few others indicated that they could have supported such a decision,” the minutes stated.*

*“Several participants noted that a 25 basis point reduction would be in line with a gradual path of policy normalization that would allow policymakers time to assess the degree of policy restrictiveness as the economy evolved,” the document added. “A few participants also added that a 25 basis point move could signal a more predictable path of policy normalization.“*

*Since the meeting, economic indicators have showed that the labor market is perhaps stronger than officials favoring the 50 basis point move had expected.*

*In September, nonfarm payrolls increased by 254,000, much more than expected, while the unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%.*

*The data has helped cement expectations that while the Fed likely is in the early days of an easing cycle, future cuts likely would not be as aggressive as the September move. Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials in recent days have backed the expected 50 basis points in cuts indicated by the “dot plot” unofficial forecast released after the September meeting.*

*The minutes noted that the vote to approve the 50 basis point cut came “in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks” against the labor market. The minutes noted that a “a substantial majority of participants” favored the larger move, without specifying how many were opposed. The term “participants” suggests involvement of the full FOMC rather than just the 12 voters.*

*The minutes also noted that some members favored a cut at the July meeting that never materialized.*

*Though the document was more detailed about the debate over whether to approve the 25 basis point cut, there was not as much information about why voters supported the larger move.*

*At this post-meeting news conference, Powell used the term “recalibration” to sum up the decision to cut, and the term also appears in the minutes.*

*“Participants emphasized that it was important to communicate that the recalibration of the stance of policy at this meeting should not be interpreted as evidence of a less favorable economic outlook or as a signal that the pace of policy easing would be more rapid than participants’ assessments of the appropriate path,” the minutes stated.*

*Such a recalibration would bring policy “into better alignment with recent indicators of inflation and the labor market.” Supporters of the 50 basis point cut “also emphasized that such a move would help sustain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to promote progress on inflation, and would reflect the balance of risks.“*

*Under normal circumstances, the Fed prefers to cut in quarter-point increments. Previously, the Fed moved by half a point only during Covid and, before that, the 2008 financial crisis.*

*Market pricing is pointing to the fed funds rate ending 2025 in the 3.25%-3.5% range, about in line with the median projection of a 3.4% rate, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch. Futures markets previously had been indicating a more aggressive path and in fact now are pricing in about a 1-in-5 chance that the Fed does not cut at its November 6-7 meeting.*

*The bond market, though, has been acting differently. Since the Fed meeting, both the 10- and 2-year Treasury yields have surged about 40 basis points.*",2024-10-09,0.99,Positive,"['FOMC', 'CME']"
Why I Think There’s an 85% Chance the Market Goes Up Tomorrow After CPI Data,1fzw1s4,Fit-Possibility-1045,2024-10-09 22:18:44,0,0.41,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fzw1s4/why_i_think_theres_an_85_chance_the_market_goes/,"With the CPI data set to be released tomorrow, I'm feeling optimistic about the market's potential to close in the green. Here’s why I believe there's an 85% chance the market will rise following the CPI announcement:  
  
Projected Inflation Rates: Analysts are forecasting a year-over-year CPI increase of around 2.3%, which would be a significant drop from previous months

If this prediction holds true, it signals easing inflationary pressures, which typically boosts investor confidence.  
Market Sentiment: Historical trends suggest that when CPI data comes in lower than expected, markets, particularly the Nasdaq, often react positively. A lower inflation rate might lead to speculation that the Federal Reserve will take a less aggressive approach to interest rate hikes.

This sentiment could drive up stock prices as investors shift their focus back to growth opportunities.  
External Factors: Recent trends show declining energy prices, which have contributed to lowering overall inflation​.

If these trends continue and align with the CPI data, it could further reinforce a bullish outlook among traders.  
Earnings and Economic Indicators: Positive reports from the labor market and other economic indicators support the idea that the economy is on solid footing.

  
If the CPI data confirms this narrative, we could see a substantial market rally.  
Of course, nothing is guaranteed in the markets, but the combination of favorable CPI projections, historical market responses, and supportive economic conditions gives me a strong sense of optimism.

The machinists walked off the job on Sept. 13 after overwhelmingly rejecting a tentative labor deal, halting production of most of Boeing's aircraft, which are made in the Puget Sound area. Boeing later sweetened the offer, increasing pay raises, a ratification bonus and other improvements, which the union turned down, arguing that it was not negotiated.

Talks again broke down this week, meaning the strike will continue. The stoppage will cost Boeing more than $1 billion per month, S&P Global Ratings said Tuesday as it issued a negative outlook for the aerospace giant's credit ratings.

Stephanie Pope, CEO of Boeing's commercial aircraft unit, said the company improved contract pay during talks this week but said the union didn't consider the proposals.

""Instead, the union made non-negotiable demands far in excess of what can be accepted if we are to remain competitive as a business,"" Pope said in a staff note.

> Samsung Vice Chairman, Jun Young-hyun, who is the new head of the company’s Device Solutions Division, issued a rare apology Tuesday after the company posted disappointing third-quarter profit guidance. The leading memory chip manufacturer projected that its operating profit for the quarter ending in September will be approximately 9.10 trillion won, missing LSEG expectations. Analysts polled by LSEG expected an operating profit of 11.456 trillion Korean won ($7.7 billion) for the quarter ended Sept. 30. 


This is the apology

> Dear customers, investors, and employees who have always loved Samsung Electronics. Today, the management of Samsung Electronics would like to apologize to you first. We have caused concerns about our fundamental technological competitiveness and the future of the company due to our performance falling short of the market’s expectations. Many people are talking about Samsung’s crisis. We, who are leading the business, are responsible for all of this.

> Customers, investors, and employees. Samsung, however, has always turned crises into opportunities, having a history of challenge, innovation, and overcoming. We will definitely make the dire situation we are currently facing an opportunity for a leap forward. Our management will take the lead in overcoming the crisis.

> Above all, we will restore our fundamental technological competitiveness. Technology and quality are our lifeblood. It is Samsung Electronics’ pride that we can never compromise on. Rather than short-term solutions, we will secure fundamental competitiveness. Furthermore, I believe that only new technologies that do not exist in the world and perfect quality competitiveness are the only ways for Samsung Electronics to make a comeback.

> Second, we will prepare for the future more thoroughly. We will rekindle our unique passion to pioneer the future without fear and to cling to our goals until the end and achieve them. We will re-arm ourselves with a challenging spirit to run toward a higher goal, rather than a defensive mindset to protect what we have.

> Third, we will look again at our organizational culture and working methods and immediately fix what needs to be fixed. We will rebuild our traditional organizational culture of trust and communication. If we find problems in the field, we will expose them as they are and have fierce discussions to improve them. In particular, we will actively communicate with our investors whenever we have the opportunity.

> Dear customers, investors, and employees.

> If we fiercely challenge ourselves, we are confident that we can turn the current crisis into a new opportunity. Please give us your support and encouragement so that Samsung Electronics can once again demonstrate its strength.

"Deep dive into Starbucks - Optimized for choice, not profit.",1fzs4qx,k_ristovski,2024-10-09 19:31:52,0,0.44,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fzs4qx/deep_dive_into_starbucks_optimized_for_choice_not/,"**1.0 Introduction**

Starbucks isn't just a coffee chain; it's a place where your drink comes with a version of your name on the cup. While this small detail doesn’t change the quality of the product, it has a big impact on customers:

1. **Personalization** - People naturally crave recognition, and this simple interaction taps into that need, making the experience feel more personal, even if it is just a name on a cap.
2. **Customer engagement** - Calling out names for orders, often with humorous misspellings, creates a memorable experience that extends beyond the store. Countless social media posts about these misspellings have gone viral, and this kind of engagement works to Starbucks' advantage.

The customer-centric culture is what allowed the company to grow to almost 40,000 locations worldwide (\~18,000 in the U.S.).



**2.0 The struggle**

Starbucks is perceived as a company with a strong brand.

***But is that true?***

***What does it mean?***

***What does a strong brand bring to the table?***

A strong brand has **pricing power**. It can charge premium prices and raise them in an inflationary environment, **without experiencing a decline in the quantity of products (or services) sold.**

The revenue formula for a company of this kind is simple:

**Revenue** = **Quantity of products sold** x **Price.**

Over the last decade, there have been some inflationary times.

Based on Finance Buzz, Starbucks increased the prices of their products by 39%, the lowest among the chains included in the research. This is slightly above the inflation rate, so it can be argued that the company managed to fully pass the costs to the final customer.

However, the second part of the equation was the **quantity.** A company with strong pricing power should not experience a decline in the amount of products (or services) sold. Unfortunately, this isn’t true for Starbucks.

The company has experienced lower revenue for two quarters in a row compared to the same quarters in the prior year. Their comparable store sales have decreased, meaning they **bring less revenue per store despite the price increase.** **This isn’t a characteristic of a company with a strong brand and pricing power.**

The CEO at the time, Laxman Narasimhan had a terrible CNBC appearance after the Q2 results. His explanation for the poor results was “***We didn’t communicate the value we provide***” - Which I find ridiculous. I don’t think the reason for the poor results is a lack of communication.

But, it gets worse. In the quarterly, release, there was a section related to the strategic priorities. The one that caught me by surprise was **“Become truly global”.** What does this even mean? Isn’t a company with \~40,000 locations “global” enough?



**3.0 The actual reasons for the struggle**

So, what is happening? **Why is Starbucks struggling?** While studying the company in depth, I’ve identified the following 4 reasons:

1. **More is not always better** - The menu continues to expand, offering more options and customizations. When the orders start shifting away from standard to customized, it leads to longer times to prepare a beverage. This leads to **fewer drinks** being prepared (and sold) per hour and **longer waiting times**. From a financial point of view, the cost per beverage goes up, and then it is passed on to the final customer. However, why should the customers pay more? What changed? For many, the waiting time increased. Ultimately, many customers (including loyal ones) decided that the current value for money offered by Starbucks wasn’t worth it, and looked for alternatives.
2. **China's competitive landscape** - As the second-largest market, it decreased a 14% in the latest quarter. The local rivals have been undercutting Starbucks in price.
3. **Mobile app disappointment** - Mobile orders account for roughly a third of Starbucks’ U.S. orders. This leads to a lot of customers simultaneously waiting for their orders, with overwhelmed baristas trying to keep up with it. However, there is also another psychological aspect. The total waiting time comprises **order time** & **preparation time.** Most customers remember “waiting” as the time between ***placing the order and receiving the beverage***. With mobile apps, the order is done without having to wait in line and although the total waiting time is the same, the preparation time is longer. Reducing the order time isn’t a benefit that stands out.
4. **Worsening reputation** - In 2021, employees started organizing and forming a labor union, motivated by concerns over workplace conditions, wages, unpredictable schedules, and overall job security. Starbucks has been accused of using aggressive tactics to prevent unionization, via anti-union messaging, store closures and firings, and even increased surveillance and intimidation. As of 2024, the company continues to face legal challenges from the NLRB (“National Labor Relations Board“) and ongoing unionization efforts.



**4.0 The solution (?)**

On August 13th, 2024, Starbucks announced that Brian Niccol has been appointed chairman and CEO of Starbucks, starting September 9th, 2024.

This is been seen as part of Elliott Management’s activist campaign.

**Brian Niccol is the 4th CEO of Starbucks in the last 3 years.**

The share price was up 24% on this announcement, which shows the market sentiment of this decision. Brian has been the CEO of Chipotle since 2018 and the CEO of Taco Bell before that. He has extensive experience in operations and is expected to bring new energy and ideas.

There will be plenty of similarities between his past roles and this one, especially focused on improving efficiency and cost-reduction, given his experience in digital improvement and online/mobile app ordering.

On September 10th, his 2nd official working day, he shared a letter to all partners, customers, and stakeholders with 4 key areas of focus:

1. **Empowering the baristas to take care of the customers**
2. **Get the morning right, every morning** by delivering outstanding drinks and food, on time, every time.
3. **Reestablishing Starbucks as the community coffeehouse** committing to elevate the in-store experience, ensuring the spaces reflect the sights, smells, and sounds that define Starbucks.
4. **Telling the Starbucks story**

In addition to this, he mentions that investments in technology are being made, to enhance the customer experience, improve the supply chain, and evolve the app and mobile ordering platform. His comment on China is that the company needs to *understand the potential path to capture growth and capitalize on its strengths in this dynamic market.*

He’s also addressing that in some places, especially in the U.S. the menus can feel overwhelming, the product is inconsistent, the wait is too long and the handoff too hectic.

In my opinion, this short letter of 2 pages, does a great job of addressing all the key challenges the company is facing (as outlined above).

Finally, there’s someone who takes responsibility, points out exactly what is going wrong, and not only hints at what is coming next but has experience in doing this before. To me, it seems that **Starbucks found the right person**.

This is also why if everything goes according to plan, he’s getting a compensation package above $100m.

But it is not going to be easy, nor fast. Changes of this kind will take time, especially given the size of the company. It would not be unreasonable to expect the first meaningful changes in 2-4 quarters.



**5.0 Valuation**

Given everything above, it doesn't come as a surprise that the company’s operating margin has decreased from 17% to 15% (over the last decade).

The company is still a cash machine bringing over $6 billion in cash from operations (with a limited Share-based compensation of \~$300m).

One of the key questions is - Given what is known today, how much is the company worth? I’ll give Brian the benefit of the doubt, and assume that he can implement the best automation tools to help baristas, get the menu under control, and bring the operating profitability to \~19%, which is optimistic.

At the same time, I’ll assume the growth will continue more or less at the same pace as the last few years but will be decelerating over time.

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is $99b **($88/share),** slightly below today’s share price of $96.

Here’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue in 10 years & the operating margin:

|Revenue / Operating margin|15%|17%|19%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|79% ($65.3b)|$54|$65|$75|
|110% ($76.5b)|$63|$76|$88|
|126% ($82.4b)|$68|$81|$94|

Historically, Starbucks was always trading at a premium, as it was perceived as a company with strong brand and pricing power (hence, lower risk). I’d argue that right now, it doesn’t deserve that premium.

The market is already pricing a turnaround story.

Bayer shares drop 7% after U.S. court announces review of Monsanto case,1fzqto3,Puginator,2024-10-09 18:30:28,278,0.95,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fzqto3/bayer_shares_drop_7_after_us_court_announces/,"Shares of German life sciences company Bayer fell nearly 7% on Wednesday, after a U.S. court said it would review a case alleging that exposure to products of the company’s Monsanto unit harmed individuals.

The Washington Supreme Court this week accepted a review of litigation against the German company over the impact of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) exposure at the Sky Valley Education Center in Washington state, one of many related cases Bayer is fighting. Previously, an appeals court had overturned a $185 million award in the trial after finding flaws in the case in May, according to Reuters.

Bayer shares were 6.76% lower at 12:45 p.m. London time, putting the stock on course for its worst performance since March and extending a loss of 13% in the year to date. Shares had tumbled more than 30% last year amid challenges including ongoing litigation over the Monsanto unit and high net debt.

The company said in a statement Wednesday that there was “no basis for a different outcome on appeal,” and that it believed the Washington Court of Appeals’ decision had identified three errors in the case, including that testimony for the plaintiffs regarding PCB exposure lacked scientific validity.

Bayer argues the claims relate to industrial materials which Monsanto voluntarily ended manufacture of in 1977.

Bayer acquired U.S. agrichemical-maker Monsanto in 2018.

The deal has led to the company fighting myriad legal challenges in various U.S. courts over alleged negative health effects, including cancer, from exposure to Monsanto products including Roundup weed killer.

According to Reuters, around 125,000 charges have been brought against the product in the U.S., more than half of which had been resolved following a $10.9 billion settlement in 2020.

In September, the company secured a legal win when the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia found in its favor in a claim that Monsanto violated state law by failing to add a cancer warning to the Roundup label.

* ALT is providing a liver fatty solution through regulatory pathways that are covered by INSURANCE, to the core they do address Obesity - but do not go along with the hype.  
* The Obesity/MASH/NASH market is growing. Diabetes and such liver fatty related health issues will grow. Ozempic and such, expensive and hard to get - black market abuse likely to cause problems.  Alternatives through a doctor and covered by insurance, much needed. 
* ALT stated clearly: No Phase 3 without partner. 2 options:
   * Since no new CFO,  they will sell the pipeline.  The pipeline is very much connected, one partner for one product would not make sense. 
   * They will present a partner very soon, as they also stated a partner is preferred in trial design and should preferably be present at the FDA meeting next month.

**About Pemvidutide**  
Pemvidutide is a novel, investigational, peptide-based GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist in development for the treatment of obesity and MASH. Activation of the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors is believed to mimic the complementary effects of diet and exercise on weight loss, with GLP-1 suppressing appetite and glucagon increasing energy expenditure. Glucagon is also recognized as having direct effects on hepatic fat metabolism, which is believed to lead to rapid reductions in levels of liver fat and serum lipids. In clinical trials to date, once-weekly pemvidutide has demonstrated compelling weight loss, robust reductions in triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, liver fat content and blood pressure. The U.S. FDA has granted Fast Track designation to pemvidutide for the treatment of MASH. Pemvidutide recently completed the MOMENTUM Phase 2 obesity trial and is being studied in the ongoing IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial.

Bloomberg: US Says It’s Weighing Google Breakup as Monopoly Case Remedy,1fzhd9r,Fidler_2K,2024-10-09 08:02:58,483,0.96,170,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fzhd9r/bloomberg_us_says_its_weighing_google_breakup_as/,"The US Justice Department told a federal judge it is considering recommending that Google be forced to sell off parts of its operations to alleviate the harm caused by its monopolization of the online search market, in what would be a historic antitrust breakup.

In a court filing Tuesday, antitrust enforcers said Judge Amit Mehta could also force the Alphabet Inc. unit to provide access to the underlying data it uses to build its search results and artificial intelligence products.

The Justice Department “is considering behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features — including emerging search access points and features, such as artificial intelligence — over rivals or new entrants,” the agency said in the filing.

The filing represents Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. The 32-page filing lays outs a framework of potential options for the judge to consider as the case moves to the remedy phase.

Antitrust enforcers said Google gained scale and data benefits from its illegal distribution agreements with other tech companies that made make its search engine the default option on smartphones and web browsers.

Mehta, who ruled this summer that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets, plans to hold a trial on the proposed remedy next spring and issue a decision by August 2025. Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta’s decision, but must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so.

Google’s Android business encompasses the operating system used on smartphones and devices as well as apps.

On Monday, a different federal judge ordered Google to open up its app store for the next three years to resolve a separate antitrust case related to its dominance of app distribution on Android smartphones. The company also plans to appeal that decision.

Roblox: Inflated Key Metrics For Wall Street And A Pedophile Hellscape For Kids,1fz4zma,deevee12,2024-10-08 22:39:35,205,0.91,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fz4zma/roblox_inflated_key_metrics_for_wall_street_and_a/,"[https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/)

Hindenburg just put out their latest short report, and it features none other than everyone's favorite ~~parenting substitute~~ child-oriented gaming platform Roblox. In a way the allegations are unsurprising to anyone that's been following this company, but this goes WAY more in depth than anything that has come out before.  
  
Summary bullet points from the beginning of the article:

*  Roblox is a $27 billion online gaming platform headquartered in San Mateo, CA. The company was incorporated in 2004 and is led by founder and CEO David Baszucki.
* The company has reported net losses every quarter since becoming a public company, with last twelve months (LTM) losses totaling $1.07 billion. Its stock trades at 8.6x sales, a 57% premium to gaming peers, pricing in expectations of rapid future growth and profitability.
* Insiders have cashed out $1.7 billion in stock since the company’s 2021 direct listing. In the last 12 months, insiders have sold \~$150 million in stock, including \~$115 million by CEO Baszucki personally.
* Since Roblox isn’t profitable, its stock price (and, in turn, insiders’ ability to dump hundreds of millions of dollars of stock) is reliant on the growth metrics it presents to Wall Street.
* Our research indicates that Roblox is lying to investors, regulators, and advertisers about the number of “people” on its platform, inflating the key metric by 25-42%+. We also show how engagement hours, another key metric, is inflated by an estimated 100%+.
* Since prior to going public, Roblox has reported the number of “people” on its platform in dozens of official investor communications. Among many examples, Roblox wrote in a 2022 quarterly report, “there are over 54.1 million **people** coming to Roblox every day”.
* Our findings show that the company’s reported number of “people” regularly matches Roblox’s reported Daily Active Users (DAUs).
* But DAUs, according to Roblox’s own disclosures, “are not a measure of unique individuals accessing Roblox” because they can include numerous accounts run by a single person, such as alternate or bot accounts.
* Given these definitions, we believe Roblox intentionally conflates “people” with DAUs, consistently inflating the reported number of people on its platform.
* In 2023, Roblox told the SEC it is “unable to identify if a user has multiple accounts”. The company’s response to the SEC appears to be a flat out lie.
* Multiple former employees told us that Roblox does internally track single users with multiple accounts, referring to the process as ‘de-alting’.
* Interviews reveal Roblox effectively has two sets of books for counting users: one for internal business decisions, in which multiple accounts are ‘de-alted’, and one used by the finance team that reports higher metrics to investors.
* “If that number \[DAUs\] is not de-alted, I think the actual one would be like anywhere between 30 to 20 percent lower”, a former data scientist told us.
* Roblox forums detail how users regularly have dozens of alternate accounts to “farm” for goods on Roblox, avert bans and increase their follower counts, among other reasons.
* In addition to alternate accounts, bots are rampant on the platform. For example, Roblox’s 7^(th) most popular game, Adopt Me!, has garnered over 83,000 [Change.org](http://Change.org) signatures to remove it from the platform due to extensive “botting” that “breaks” Roblox.
* Roblox’s 2^(nd) most visited game, Blox Fruits, was dominated by traffic from Vietnam, where we found numerous Facebook groups, including 5 with 50,000 to 117,000 members each, advertising and soliciting tools to run 20+ Roblox bot tabs at a time.
* A former data scientist told us that activity in Vietnam “inflated a lot of our numbers. Like crazy, insane, in terms of engagement, DAU\[s\]”.
* In addition to inflating the reported number of “people” on its platform, we also suspect Roblox massively inflates a second key metric, “engagement hours”. The company reported an extraordinary 2.4 average hours of engagement per day per user in 2023.
* This level of engagement is 58% higher than the average time spent by U.S. 8-12 year olds playing all mobile games (including tablet), according to a 2021 survey, and 26%-166% more time than leading social media platforms such as YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.
* To better understand the company’s reported engagement, we hired a technical consultant that monitored the top \~7,200 Roblox games across \~2.1 million Roblox servers, collecting 297.7 million rows of real-time player data.
* The data suggests that Roblox could be massively overstating the true level of user engagement across its platform: our review of an average of 30.4 million unique daily users found they spent just \~22 minutes in games per day.
* Further analysis of play times showed numerous games in which obvious bot accounts remained in-game for more than 24 hours straight. Our representative sample flagged millions of ‘zombie’ engagement hours that can majorly skew Roblox’s reported “average” engagement.
* Roblox incentivizes developers to create ‘AFK’ (Away From Keyboard) games that artificially inflate engagement by tying developer pay in part to engagement. Web forums detail developer strategies for creating features that encourage bots and zombie engagement.
* We think Roblox can and should report its estimated de-alted and de-botted metrics so that investors, advertisers, and regulators can be better informed about the actual number of “people” on the platform, and their genuine level of engagement.
* Beyond inflated key user metrics, our in-game research revealed an X-rated pedophile hellscape, exposing children to grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech.
* Roblox is compromising child safety in order to report growth to investors, per our interview with a former senior product designer: “If you’re limiting users’ engagement, it’s hurting your metrics…in a lot of cases, the leadership doesn’t want that.”
* For the second quarter of 2024, in a push toward profitability, Roblox reported a 2% year-over-year decline in its trust and safety expenses.
* Core to the problem is that Roblox’s social media features allow pedophiles to efficiently target hundreds of children, with no up-front screening to prevent them from joining the platform.
* For example, in 2018, prior to Roblox going public, a 29-year-old was caught by police with 175 hours of video footage of him grooming and engaging in explicit behavior with 150 minors using online platforms, namely Roblox.
* Media and non-profit exposés from 2020 to July 2024 revealed digital strip clubs, red light districts, sex parties and child predators lurking on Roblox. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation in 2024 labeled Roblox “a tool for sexual predators, a threat for childrens’ safety”.
* Numerous criminal indictments from 2019-2024 allege that sexual predators groomed children in-game, ranging from 8-14 years old, then kidnapped, raped or traded sexual content with them.
* Following years of scandals, we performed our own checks to see if the platform had cleaned up its act. As a test, we attempted to set up an account under the name ‘Jeffrey Epstein’…only to see the name was taken, along with 900+ variations.
* Many were Jeffrey Epstein fan accounts, including “JeffEpsteinSupporter” which had earned multiple badges for spending time in kid’s games. Other Jeff Epstein accounts had the usernames “@igruum\_minors” \[I groom minors\], and “@RavpeTinyK1dsJE” \[rape tiny kids\].
* We attempted to set up a Roblox account under the name of another notorious pedophile to see if Roblox had any up-front pedophile screening: Earl Brian Bradley was indicted on 471 charges of molesting, raping and exploiting 103 children. The username was taken, along with multiple variants like earlbrianbradley69.
* After we found a username, we listed our age as “under 13” to see if children are being exposed to adult content. By merely plugging ‘adult’ into the Roblox search bar, we found a group called “Adult Studios” with 3,334 members openly trading child pornography and soliciting sexual acts from minors.
* We tracked some of the members of “Adult Studios” and easily found 38 Roblox groups – one with 103,000 members – openly soliciting sexual favors and trading child pornography.
* The chatrooms trading in child pornography had no age restrictions. Roblox reports that 21% of its users are under the age of 9, a number that is likely underestimated given that Roblox has no age verification aside from users seeking 17+ experiences.
* Registered as a child, we were also able to access games like “Escape to Epstein Island” and “Diddy Party”. We found over 600 “Diddy” games, including “Survive Diddy” and “Run From Diddy Simulator”.
* Since September 2nd, 2024, third-party monitor ‘Moderation For Dummies’ has reported \~12,400 erotic roleplay accounts on Roblox. These include everything from “rape/forceful sex fetishes” to underage users “willing to do anything for Robux”.
* Users seeking sexual experiences on Roblox are so pervasive that there are thousands of Roblox sex videos on porn sites, inviting users of unknown ages to make explicit content on the platform.
* We tested out Roblox’s experiences to see what else kids were being exposed to. We quickly encountered images of male genitalia and hate speech in Roblox’s “school simulator” game, which had registered 28.9 million visits with no age restrictions.
* Despite the company’s mission “to connect a billion users with optimism and civility”, we found games such as “Beat Up Homeless Outside 7/11 Simulator”, which had 1 million visits and 15,000 favorites before being removed from Roblox.
* Nonetheless, Roblox users identifying as 9 years old and up can still beat up homeless people in “Beat Up People Outside of 7/11” with over 900,000 visits.
* In the game “Beat Up The Pregnant”, users hacked pregnant women to death in a Wal-Mart parking lot with machetes or killed them with frying pans or a selection of guns.
* We played “\[GUNS\] Work at a Hospital” where users can go on a hospital shooting rampage. The game has \~1.6 million visits and remains on the platform with no age restrictions. The game’s thumbnail is a picture of a terrified pregnant woman.
* “LGBTQ+ Vibes” is a game available to all ages that has accumulated over 40.6 million visits and over 224,000 favorites. Users regularly described lewd sex acts while others used hateful slurs.
* “Palestine And Israel Hangout” allows kids of all ages to purchase bombs and knives and attack each other. This game has \~13 million visits and \~7,200 favorites and remains on the platform.
* Posing as a child in Roblox’s “therapy” experience, our therapist introduced himself as a “rapper with only one p”. We were advised to run away from home and that he would come pick us up so we could move into his basement in exchange for paying rent with our body.
* Some games seem to encourage illicit interactions, like “Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe” and “XYZ Club Vibe” with 31 million collective visits. Both are available to users who self-identify as 9+ years old, who can simulate sex in bathrooms wearing skimpy outfits.
* Other Roblox users have identified issues of simulated rape, naked users, and rampant in-game sexual harassment.
* Despite Roblox’s claims of “best in the world” content moderation, our interviews with moderators show safety was largely outsourced to Asian call centers. Moderators described being paid $12 a day to review countless instances of child grooming and bullying with a limited ability to keep perpetrators off the platform permanently.
* Compounding all of the above issues, Roblox faces saturation in its top markets like the U.S. and Europe. It is now attempting to keep the appearance of growth alive by adding loss-generating users in markets like Asia, per a former employee. Profitability has plummeted despite reporting higher user metrics.
* The conversion rate of new daily active users to paying users has been in steady decline since 2020. Roblox is now hoping to drive incremental growth by pitching advertisers that \~79.5 million “people” spend an average of 2.4 hours per day on the platform.
* As noted earlier, we suspect these metrics are wildly inflated and that the platform poses major reputational risks for advertisers. For instance, we found Instagram ads in the same school simulator game with Nazi hate speech and photos of male genitalia.
* Overall, we think Roblox has adopted the Silicon Valley approach of ‘growth at all costs’, whether by misleading or outright lying to investors about its key metrics or by opening its platform to dangerous predators and illicit content unsuitable for children.",2024-10-08,0.9864,Positive,"['WAY', 'CA', 'CEO', 'LTM', 'CEO', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'DAU', 'AFK', 'GUNS', 'LGBTQ', 'XYZ']"

As the title says, I’m wondering if it’s possible to access historical data from 5 years ago for NASDAQ stocks. Specifically, I want to analyze trades from May 2019 to December 2021. For each trade, I have the exact date and either the opening and closing price or the opening and closing time. I need to view 1-minute and 5-minute charts with data on Volume, VWAP, and sometimes EMAs and SMAs. For some trades, I also need Level 2 data, as well as access to Pre-Market and After-Hours data.

From what I’ve seen, TradingView offers only 40,000 historical bars even on their most expensive plan, which isn’t enough. To make matters worse, many of the traded stocks are either bankrupt, merged, or have moved to the OTC market.

I use IBKR and can access some data there, but they don’t have an option to jump directly to a specific date on the chart. This means I have to scroll manually for an hour to find the right period, and when I change the time frame, I have to start over...

I’m even open to coding my own software for viewing charts, but I’m not sure where to find the data. Additionally, I’d like to test stock scanners for those periods to find parameters that would have identified the exact stocks on the exact dates.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Samsung posts worse-than-expected guidance for third quarter,1fymu1j,Puginator,2024-10-08 05:43:49,55,0.96,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fymu1j/samsung_posts_worsethanexpected_guidance_for/,"South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics said it expects worse-than-expected profit for the third quarter.

In guidance released Tuesday, the world’s top memory chip maker said operating profit for the quarter ending September is projected to be around 9.10 trillion won, marking a surge from last year’s 2.43 trillion Korean won.

Analysts polled by LSEG expected an operating profit of 11.456 trillion Korean won ($7.7 billion) for the quarter ended Sept. 30. Samsung’s revenue for the quarter was expected to hit 81.96 trillion won ($61 billion), according to LSEG estimates.

Samsung is the leading manufacturer of memory chips, which are utilized in devices like laptops and servers. It is also the world’s second largest player in the smartphone market.

“The company needs to remain flexible about its memory supply control, since the downfall of conventional DRAM will likely hurt Samsung more than its smaller rivals,” Macquarie Equity Research analysts said in a recent note. DRAM refers to dynamic random access memory chips that are often used in laptops, workstations and PCs.

Samsung had instructed its subsidiaries around the world to reduce 30% of staff in some divisions, Reuters reported in September, citing two sources with knowledge of the matter.

Shares of Samsung Electronics listed in South Korea’s stock exchange have seen a 22% decrease year-to-date, LSEG data showed. The company is set to release detailed third-quarter results later this month.

SPY with dividends invested return: 13.66%  
SPY without dividends invested return: 12.46%

The whole point is to see how much your money would have grown if you had invested it - and not including dividends makes you miss out on quite a bit of the full story!

Not just that - it makes stocks that give dividends appear less attractive on the charts when you are comparing to other stocks.

US judge orders Google to open up app store to competition,1fyfqcs,JRshoe1997,2024-10-08 00:36:03,275,0.94,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fyfqcs/us_judge_orders_google_to_open_up_app_store_to/,"A U.S. judge on Monday ordered Alphabet's Google to overhaul its mobile app business to give Android users more options to download apps and to pay for transactions within them, following a jury verdict last year for “Fortnite” maker Epic Games.

The injunction by U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco outlined the changes Google must undertake to open up its lucrative app store, Play, to greater competition, including making Android apps available from rival sources.

Donato's order said that for three years Google cannot prohibit the use of in-app payment methods and must allow users to download competing third-party Android app platforms or stores.

The order restricts Google from making payments to device makers to preinstall its app store and from sharing revenue generated from the Play store with other app distributors.

Google and Epic did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Alphabet shares were down nearly 2% following the ruling. Donato said Epic and Google must establish a three-person technical committee to implement and monitor the injunction. Epic and Google each get a pick, and those two members will select the third person.

Epic’s lawsuit, filed in 2020, accused Google of monopolizing how consumers access apps on Android devices and how they pay for in-app transactions.

The Cary, North Carolina-based company persuaded a jury in December 2023 that Google unlawfully stifled competition through its controls over app distribution and payments, paving the way for Donato's injunction.

Google had urged Donato to reject Epic’s proposed reforms, arguing they were costly, overly restrictive and could harm consumer privacy and security. The judge mostly dismissed those arguments during an August hearing.

“You’re going to end up paying something to make the world right after having been found to be a monopolist,” he told Google's lawyers.

In a separate antitrust case in Washington, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta on Aug. 5 ruled for the U.S. Justice Department and said Google had illegally monopolized Web search, spending billions to become the internet’s default search engine.

Google also began a trial in September in Virginia federal court in a Justice Department lawsuit over its dominance in the market for advertising technology.

Google has denied the claims in all three cases.

"Super Micro soars after company says it's shipping over 100,000 AI GPUs per quarter",1fydgxp,Puginator,2024-10-07 23:03:28,217,0.95,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fydgxp/super_micro_soars_after_company_says_its_shipping/,"Super Micro Computer shares jumped 15% after the computer server company said it’s shipping more than 100,000 graphics processing units used for artificial intelligence per quarter.

That could translate into several billions of dollars of orders if the average price of a GPU is around the cost of Nvidia’s $30,000 chip. The GPU figure was revealed in an announcement about a new cooling product unveiled by Super Micro on Monday.

As one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, Super Micro makes computers that companies use as servers for data storage, websites, AI training models and more. The company said its new cooling product will allow data centers to spend less on hardware costs and cooling infrastructure for servers that typically need to be running constantly.

Super Micro also said it recently deployed more than 100,000 GPUs with liquid cooling solution “for some of the largest AI factories ever built,” as well as other cloud service providers.

While the announcement was cheered by Wall Street, Super Micro is about nine weeks behind in reporting its annual report, which was expected in August. The company said late that month that management needed additional time “to complete its assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024.” 

Even after Monday’s rally, the stock is down by well over 50% since peaking in March. Shares fell 12% on Sept. 26, after the Wall Street Journal reported the Department of Justice opened a probe into the company following a report from short-seller Hindenburg Research in which the firm alleged it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.”

This one caught my eyes, because I'm a believer in the *Great Rotation*, and sooner or later, over-coverage fatigue will set-in with A.I and tech stocks. Not to mention, the power hungry data centers can't be fueled alone with solar or wind. Traditional energy is here to stay. This is also a good diversifier in tech-heavy portfolios (that we all have).

I'm also a half-believer in *energy transition* bandwagon. This (should) sound like almost a propaganda to anyone with analytical mind of 12 year old. Renewables are fine as a ""top-up"" source or to smooth out peak demands. EVs - where do they get their power from? Much of logistics, happening with trucks and ships, still remains dependent on oil & gas. It's plain science. A battery simply won't have enough juice to pull a truck load or power a ship across oceans. Just one litre of fuel packs more than 10 units of energy (3 hour charge at 3 KW).

Now specifically for Shell Plc, a few things caught my eyes -

1. Q3 guidance and better refining margins outlook
2. Expected severe cold winter in Europe 
3. $3.5B buyback and juicy 4% dividend yield 
4. Historically low valuation, with rising crude/gas prices ",2024-10-07,0.9156,Positive,['KW']

Robotaxis are here and the public is divided. Alphabet owned Waymo is the leader in the space. Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi launch.,1fy93q7,Guy_PCS,2024-10-07 20:03:26,188,0.81,261,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fy93q7/robotaxis_are_here_and_the_public_is_divided/,"Driverless cars are speeding onto America’s streets, but whether the public will trust robotaxis remains an open question. 

Nearly two-thirds of Americans said they would not want to ride in a driverless passenger vehicle if they had the opportunity, according to a Pew Research Center Survey. That’s because residents in cities that have yet to experience robotaxis remain unfamiliar with the technology while those in cities with driverless cabs have not yet forgotten about high-profile accidents involving other companies, like GM-owned Cruise. 

Now Tesla, the loudest and most bullish self-driving proponent of them all, is due to unveil its long-awaited robotaxi after years of unfulfilled promises.

The company’s existing autonomous driving technology, where a human is still at the wheel, has drawn the scrutiny of regulators and multiple lawsuits after hundreds of crashes. Experts say a great presentation from CEO Elon Musk won’t guarantee a safe robotaxi network.

Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi launch threatens to throw the whole autonomous vehicle space off course. 

Alphabet-owned Waymo is the leader in the space, with the company claiming it has notched more than 22 million driverless miles. It has proven that there is strong consumer demand, with weekly paid rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin doubling in just a couple months. And Waymo has worked on building its reputation, launching an online safety hub with data arguing that its cars are safer than human drivers.

Besides Tesla, other competitors are also looking to jump into the race.

Amazon says it is getting ready to roll out its fleet of Zoox cars, and Cruise is resuming operations after a 2023 accident led regulators to ground the fleet. Wall Street is already looking ahead to a driverless future, with one analyst arguing that if it hadn’t been for generative AI, 2024 would have been the year of the robotaxi. 

As driverless networks scale, one of the fiercest debates is whether ride-sharing will survive. Robotaxis may cause consumers to question if they really want to book an Uber or Lyft and talk to a stranger, sit in someone else’s car and tip a human if there is a driverless alternative. Uber has hedged its bets by inking high-profile deals with autonomous vehicle companies, but it’s unclear how long those partnerships will last.",2024-10-07,0.9645,Positive,"['GM', 'CEO', 'AI']"

I asking because there was a high expectation of FED rate cut in September with growing unemployment and inflation going down. Now we have:

* Unemployment rate declining in September is 4.1% (4.3% in July and 4.2% in August)
* Oil prices somewhat elevated in September and it is not clear where they will go from here, as they could decline if exporters increase production.
* Larger war could cause more inflation pressure because of potential global logistic issues.

This makes me believe that it would be hard to motivate FED to decrease rates much. Would you expect rate to go below 3% in 2025? I not see why would it happen.

If the assumption above is true, then companies benefiting on higher rates will still have significant advantage. Among them are payment systems (PAYO, WISE.LSE). While PAYO have core team located in Israel, their computing power is outside. The WISE.LSE seems more secure as they distributed among safer areas.

From other point retail construction heavily dependent on low rates. However the 2024 proven that those with strong balance sheet, low debt and good management have not suffered much of losses. There are few good companies in industry (like LEN or MHO) with PE less than 15. Taking into consideration the inflation would stay within 2-3% such PE seems good enough to consider them as investment, even though risk of FED rate could stay quite elevated is high.

However, I'm struggling when it comes to small-cap stocks, especially when some are unprofitable and don't have consistent revenue history. Looking at insane revenue growth forecasts (like 1000%-2000% over the next year or two feels unrealistic and not very useful for screening.

AI in Architecture is also still in its early stages, and Autodesk has a plethora of software tools, not just 2d and 3d drawing/modelling.

Autodesk's softwares are widely used among engineering firms and architecture firms, and have a history, so there will be alot of switching costs and dependency on the software, making customers sticky.

Autodesk also has a business model which provides free educational license accesses to their software in architecture/engineering schools, this makes students dependent on the software from the very start.

Autodesk is also a widely known industry standard for building blueprints, yes there is Sketchup, Rhino, and Grasshopper, but they are more specialised for product design, interior design, and parametric building facades which can also be exported to Autodesk's Revit to then be used in the 3d modelling there.

The above 3 points boast a very strong moat for Autodesk in my opinion.

Im an architecture student, and I dont hold any position in Autodesk yet but I most likely will in the future.

I do see that the valuation is a bit rich with a p/s of 10x compared to something like meta and it's been around for 19 years so ita questionable if they can actually grow the way they should post ipo to be profitable.

I use Schwab.  Between 4 PM when market closes and over the next few hours there will sometimes be a very small variation in the value of my stocks.

Today I looked at my stocks at 4:30 (fully 30 minutes after market close) and I was up 1.37% and just looking at it now I am up 1.35%.  The dollar value shifted ever so slightly as well.

This is not due to after hours trades and it usually only moves a very small number of basis points (usually less than five in either direction).

Is it Time to Sell DOCN? A Perspective from a Fan,1fwbmdr,Elibroftw,2024-10-05 03:56:19,8,0.7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fwbmdr/is_it_time_to_sell_docn_a_perspective_from_a_fan/,"# TL;DR

I like DOCN as a company, however I don't think it's a good stock to own for value-minded investors because I realized recently that it does not have clear/profitable competitive advantages and it's own financials do not scream that its a value play compared to stocks that I own (GOOGL, PYPL, unfortunately NET) and the three alternatives (WBD, LULU, HOOD, WEN) that I would want to own. The following is my argument for why this is a stock better suited for mass diversification rather than for stock picking.

Now that I think about it, I should've sold before I posted this. Oh well. Edit: Managed to close @ 42.85 on October 7th (Good till cancel limit order).

# Business Analysis

I have been very partial towards DigitalOcean for the last few years even when it was trading in the $100s. Back then it seemed that many people (myself included since I was naive) did not understand the true value of these tech growth stocks. Only a few years later do we see the true valuations for some of these stocks.

I opened a position in March of this year due to being a DOCN customer myself. However in the last month, I started having doubts on whether DOCN is worth including in a individual stock portfolio of \~20 ""undervalued"" stocks. At one point, I was down 10%, and now I'm up 11% which is better than my benchmark $MORT which has returned 7% during this time.

The reason I've changed my mind about DOCN is not actually due to anything they've done incorrectly. It doesn't matter that they are operating financially well, it doesn't matter how nice their products are, it doesn't matter that I personally prefer using DOCN to other platforms, it doesn't matter that they care about small businesses, it doesn't matter how cost effective they are \[1\]. The reality is that DOCN competes in an environment with many competitors and substitutes. The barrier to entry is embarrassingly low as we see serverless competitors (substitutes to VPS) like Vercel and Netlify which don't even buy hardware but people do end up spending more on them just because they choose to use JavaScript as a backend and didn't know how much performance a $5/month VPS can provide. These serverless companies rent from AWS, offer their solutions on top, and sublet at a margin. Then there are the very cost effective market (serverhunter) so competing on price alone is how we get perfect competition. Lastly, there are the behemoths of the industry: AWS, Azure, GCS, Shopify (I believe every shopify storefront is hosted on Shopify), Alibaba Cloud, etc. which are more expensive, less intuitive (excluding Shopify, and I don't know if its true for GCS or Baba Cloud), but offer some complex ready to use solutions (e.g. [live streaming](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/live-streaming-on-aws/) which Kick uses). Given that there are so many competitors that target basically every requirements a business may have (cost, solution, simplicity), I find it hard to use ""competitive advantage"" as justification to own DOCN unlike owning GOOGL. So that really leaves the question whether DOCN is currently undervalued on its own merits:

# Financial Merit Compared to My Alternative Holds and Buys

P/E is over 60, Beta over 1.5, QoQ growth has been 2-4% last 3 quarters. FCF market cap yield is 3% compared to:

* 0.64% at Cloudflare which has a competitive advantage, however not actually worth owning for value investors
* 3% at Google (which is a mature & profitable company)
* 8.26% at PYPL (which has less competition in the payments space, is profitable, and has been around longer)
* Even LULU has 5% FCF yield and the short-term bull case for that is China.
* WBD with 33% FCF yield; this is the stock I will be buying with the proceeds
* HOOD: had a high FCF yield in March

Which stock is hidding in plain sight?,1fwa7mg,istockusername,2024-10-05 02:52:49,614,0.86,1093,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fwa7mg/which_stock_is_hidding_in_plain_sight/,"Coming out of the Great Financial Crisis, Apple was a stock that was criminally undervalued, despite being a massive brand already. Over the years, there weren’t any groundbreaking inventions (outside of expanding their services), yet the stock still managed to significantly outperform the market. Even Warren Buffett, who bought in later, snagged it at a great valuation.

Now that the Fed seems to be normalizing rates and the economy has shown resilience, I’m thinking about which companies might be ""hiding in plain sight"" today.

A lot of people are betting on AI related plays, with many pointing to TSMC and ASML as indirect winners. I get the logic, but I believe that, no matter how successful they become, these companies will still trade at lower valuations compared to their U.S. counterparts. Money just tends to flow into U.S. equities first and foremost.

Personally, I think Meta is the best positioned among the ""Magnificent 7."" The TikTok threat has mostly passed, and it could even be a net positive for Meta not to be viewed as a monopoly anymore. Plus, I don’t think their AI and AR/VR investments are fully priced into the stock yet.

Amazon is lagging the other mega caps in terms of valuation, but there’s still some uncertainty around how well Andy Jassy will perform in the long term.

Any stocks you guys are eyeing? I’m particularly interested in established companies with consistent growth that still seem under represented.


tldr: Apple was once undervalued despite being a massive brand, and I'm wondering which companies today are in a similar position. AI stocks like TSMC/ASML seem popular, but I think Meta is well positioned due to AI/AR investments not yet fully priced in. Amazon also lags but could be worth watching under new leadership.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/04/mortgage-rates-jobs-report.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/04/mortgage-rates-jobs-report.html)

*Key Points*

* *The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage is now 6.53% according to Mortgage News Daily.*
* *That is 42 basis points higher than the day before the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate by half a percentage point.*

&#x200B;

*The average rate on the 30-year-fixed mortgage jumped 27 basis points Friday morning following the release of the government’s monthly employment report. The rate is now 6.53%, according to Mortgage News Daily.*

*That is 42 basis points higher than Sept. 17, the day before the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate by half a percentage point. Mortgage rates do not follow the Fed, but they loosely follow the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury.*

*For mortgage rates, it is all about what the expectation is next for the Fed. As such, there was a lot of anticipation leading up to this particular monthly report, since the last two pointed to weaker labor market conditions.*

*“Indeed, the Fed’s decision to cut by 0.50 vs 0.25 last month had much to do with the fear/expectation that reports like today’s would be in shorter supply going forward,” wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. “The only salvation here would be the notion that this is just one jobs report in a recent run that’s been mostly weaker and that perhaps the next one won’t be so damning for bonds.”*

*However, the report does shift the outlook slightly for rates going forward, since most had assumed the trajectory would be lower.*

*“MBA’s forecast is for longer-term rates, including mortgage rates, to remain within a relatively narrow range over the next year,” Mortgage Bankers Association’s chief economist Michael Fratantoni wrote after the jobs report was released. “This news will push mortgage rates to the top of that range, but we do expect that mortgage rates will stay close to 6% over the next 12 months.”*

*Today’s homebuyers are highly sensitive to rate moves, as home prices continue to rise from year-ago levels. There is also still very low inventory on the market, which has only served to keep prices higher. Rates are a full percentage point lower than they were a year ago, but the housing market has not seen much of a boost yet.*",2024-10-04,-0.9262,Negative,['MBA']

> Facebook owner Meta announced on Friday it had built a new AI model called Movie Gen that can create realistic-seeming video and audio clips in response to user prompts, claiming it can rival tools from leading media generation startups like OpenAI and ElevenLabs. Samples of Movie Gen’s creations provided by Meta showed videos of animals swimming and surfing, as well as videos using people’s real photos to depict them performing actions like painting on a canvas. Movie Gen also can generate background music and sound effects synced to the content of the videos, Meta said in a blog post, and use the tool to edit existing videos.

> In one such video, Meta had the tool insert pom-poms into the hands of a man running by himself in the desert, while in another it changed a parking lot where a man was skateboarding from dry ground into one covered by a splashing puddle. Videos created by Movie Gen can be up to 16 seconds long, while audio can be up to 45 seconds long, Meta said. It shared data showing blind tests indicating that the model performs favorably compared with offerings from startups including Runway, OpenAI, ElevenLabs and Kling.

> The announcement comes as Hollywood has been wrestling with how to harness generative AI video technology this year, after Microsoft -backed OpenAI in February first showed off how its product Sora could create feature film-like videos in response to text prompts.

*It added that the decision marked another step toward the conclusion of the Commission’s anti-subsidy investigation into electric vehicles from China, which was launched in October 2023.*

*The EU first announced that it would slap higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports in June, on the grounds that they benefit “heavily from unfair subsidies” and posed a “threat of economic injury” to electric vehicle producers in Europe.*

*Duties were also disclosed for individual companies that linked to their levels of cooperation and information they supplied to the EU as part of the bloc’s probe into EV production in China.*

*Provisional duties were put in place from early July.*

*The European Commission then revised its tariff plans in September based on “substantiated comments on the provisional measures” from interested parties.*

*A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce told reporters that Beijing continues to believe that the investigation into China’s subsidies for its electric vehicle industry has come to “pre-set conclusions,” adding that the bloc is promoting unfair competition.*

*On Friday, the EU said it was still looking for other solutions, even as the tariffs are adopted.*

*“In parallel, the EU and China continue to work hard to explore an alternative solution that would have to be fully WTO-compatible, adequate in addressing the injurious subsidization established by the Commission’s investigation, monitorable and enforceable,” it said.*

*Mercedes Benz called the tariffs a “mistake” and urged the European Commission to delay their implementation, while BMW said the move marked a “fatal sign” for Europe’s auto industry, Reuters reported. Crisis-stricken Volkswagen meanwhile called on the EU and China to continue talks about the issue, saying that an alternative solution was still possible, according to Reuters.*

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Levi Slumps After Paring Back Its Full-Year Sales Outlook,1fusde1,Ok-Swimmer-2634,2024-10-03 03:32:06,30,0.88,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fusde1/levi_slumps_after_paring_back_its_fullyear_sales/,"(Bloomberg) -- Denim maker Levi Strauss & Co. narrowed its full-year revenue outlook to the bottom end of its previous range, sending shares down sharply in extended trading.  

Net revenue is expected grow about 1% in the company’s current fiscal year, compared with a previous range of 1% to 3%. Sales in the company’s fiscal third quarter, which ended Aug. 25, were slightly short of the average analyst estimate, while its Americas division posted a revenue decline in the period. 

The shares fell 8.1% at 4:47 p.m. in extended New York trading. The stock has gained 27% this year through Wednesday’s close, outpacing the advance of the S&P Total Market Index over the same period. 

Levi is making a push to generate more sales through its own channels. While the company is making progress on that front, its wholesale business is deteriorating, with a decline of 6% in the latest quarter from a year earlier. The company wants to use its own stores, website and app for sales as shoppers increasingly move away from the department stores that have traditionally been crucial for big apparel brands. 

Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass said the company’s namesake brand is gaining ground, and touted “another great quarter of strength” for the company’s direct-to-consumer segment. That division, which includes Levi’s own website and stores, posted 10% growth. 

“The revenue miss is causing some knee-jerk pressure in the in the stock, but the core Levi’s brand performed well,” Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli wrote in a research note. He added that margins, which outperformed expectations, “were a bright spot.” 

The company is also reviewing options for its Dockers brand, “which could include a potential sale or other strategic transaction,” and has hired Bank of America as a financial adviser in the process. The brand’s sales declined 15% to $73.7 million in the latest quarter. 

The San Francisco-based company is looking to spark buzz by partnering with Beyoncé. The pop star gave the brand some unexpected publicity earlier this year with a song titled “Levii’s Jeans” on her latest album.

If you follow the news, it seems like every week you find out that in two days some big announcement or report you weren't aware was on the horizon is due to come out and effect your investing.

  
Is there any method, other than just reading news incessantly, to easily see when things like that are due to come up? Where do people get the information farther ahead of time when things are due to be reported? Is there some kind of calendar? You'd think at this point there would be some service which would allow you to look ahead three weeks and see what's due to be published in terms of market news, but it seems like I'm only ever a couple days ahead.

Hedge Funds are dumping energy stocks at the fastest pace since June 2022 according to Goldman Sachs,1fukus9,,2024-10-02 22:16:50,40,0.8,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fukus9/hedge_funds_are_dumping_energy_stocks_at_the/,"https://twitter.com/Barchart/status/1840982914831438207?t=KGgpDh5eP2UpJBngLtMX0w&s=19

 funds have been offloading US energy stocks at the fastest rate seen in five years marking the sector as the most heavily sold on Goldman Sachs’ prime brokerage trading desk last week, according to a report by Reuters.

The report cites a note sent to clients on Friday as highlighting that the rapid increase in short positions came as the S&P Energy Index (SPNY) dropped nearly 5% in the week leading up to 26 September. Although the sector rebounded with a 1% rally on Friday, driven by hopes of more Federal Reserve rate cuts following a soft inflation report, hedge funds had already ramped up their bearish bets.

Goldman Sachs noted that hedge funds targeted a variety of US energy companies, including oil and gas firms, consumable fuel providers, and equipment suppliers. The proportion of short bets outpaced long positions by a ratio of nearly six to one, signalling significant bearish sentiment in the sector.

The surge in short selling last week continued a broader trend of sustained divestment, with hedge funds having been selling off energy stocks for five consecutive weeks.

The selloff comes amid a gloomy outlook for oil prices. A recent Reuters poll of 41 analysts and economists projected that Brent crude would average $81.52 per barrel in 2024—its lowest forecast since February and down from August’s estimate of $82.86.",2024-10-02,0.4939,Positive,"['US', 'SPNY', 'US']"

Scaling AI to the Real World

AI is reshaping the world and transforming our relationship with technology, yet applying AI to operational technology in industries and critical infrastructure remains a challenge. So long as the complexity and operational burden of activating machines, equipment, vehicles, and sensors in physical systems remains high, we only achieve a fraction of AI’s true potential for automating our technology and improving our lives.

Edgescale AI was founded to overcome these challenges. Led by industry experts and thought leaders in AI, including renowned telecommunications executive Marc Rouanne, serial entrepreneur Brian Mengwasser, and San Francisco-based Intellectus Partners, Edgescale AI is revolutionizing how AI interacts with connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices in physical systems and unlocking the potential of physical AI with its ecosystem of partners.

To achieve this, Edgescale AI automates the creation of distributed, operations-grade cloud environments - Virtual Connected Edges (VCEs) - which facilitate the flow of data to and from devices and AI. Leading enterprises and software companies work with Edgescale AI to accelerate the deployment of AI and to enable more autonomous devices, make smarter decisions, and increase productivity.

""The next phase of AI is operating on real-world data,” said Brian Mengwasser, the Co-founder and CEO of Edgescale AI. ""We’ve reimagined and reinvented the cloud to encompass physical devices, where data comes from and actions have real-world impact. We eliminate the friction for our customers to deploy the latest AI capabilities anywhere. We’re proud to launch this breakthrough first with Palantir, the category leader in production-grade AI.”",2024-10-02,0.9231,Positive,"['AI', 'AM', 'WIRE', 'AI', 'NYSE', 'PLTR', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'CEO', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI']"

Their capacity was stretched, so they acquired manufacturers and also are working to expand their own internal capacity. Compared to LLY it seems like this company is more focused and leaner, which to me seems like a plus. They lowered forecasts, but I didn’t see this as warranting the drop it ended up seeing.

People aren’t going to just stop needing their medication, also from what I understand right now they have one of the most competitive oral pills for weight loss in the pipeline right now and working to offer their medication in China which has one of the largest obese populations in the world. 

Lastly it’s PE/Forward PE aren’t too high versus the average of the industry. LLY on the other hand has a PE over 100 right now and a forward PE in the 30 range. I don’t particularly buy this, both LLY and NVO have research in the pipeline, but don’t see how LLY can lower their PE by that much in the next year or so. 

I only bring up LLY in all of this because it seems like it’s been hit less than NVO. Both drugs are pretty overpriced (can stem from a  lack of regulation of PBMs) so for all this senate hearing noise, I don’t see why it effects one more than the other besides the fact that LLY is a US company and NVO is not.

What’s everyone else’s take on this? Is there something I’m missing here?

Edit: in regard to capital structure, LLY also has a greater reliance on debt than NVO. Dont necessarily think this is a bad thing, but worth noting NVO isn’t growing/expanding through added debt.

"Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter",1fuftc7,Puginator,2024-10-02 18:40:06,429,0.94,246,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fuftc7/tesla_stock_slips_after_it_reports_462890_total/,"Tesla posted its third-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Wednesday. The stock fell about 2% in premarket trading after the report.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890

Total production Q3 2024: 469,796

Analysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ending Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.

Deliveries are not defined in Tesla’s financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It’s one of the most closely-watched metrics on Wall Street.

In the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.

Tesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.

In the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.

GM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla’s, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company’s total sales.

Ford plans to report results on Wednesday.

Tesla hasn’t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to their lineup.

The company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.

Shares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.

Tesla’s brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called “racist hate,” and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.

But Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.

In its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.

Tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of “dedicated robotaxi.”

Musk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver. Meanwhile competitors like Waymo and Pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services.

*Key Points*

* *Private companies added 143,000 jobs in September, an acceleration from 103,000 in August and better than the 128,000 consensus forecast, ADP reported Wednesday.*
*  *Job gains were fairly widespread, with leisure and hospitality leading at 34,000, followed by construction (26,000) and education and health services (24,000).*

&#x200B;

*Private sector hiring picked up in September, indicating the labor market is holding its ground despite some signs of weakness, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday.*  
*Companies added 143,000 jobs for the month, an acceleration from the upwardly revised 103,000 in August and better than the 128,000 consensus forecast from economists polled by Dow Jones.*  
*While hiring increased, the rate of pay growth took another step down. The 12-month gain for those staying in their jobs nudged lower to 4.7%, while tumbling to 6.6% for job switchers, down 0.7 percentage point from August.*  
*Job gains were fairly widespread, with leisure and hospitality leading at 34,000, followed by construction (26,000), education and health services (24,000), professional and business services (20,000) and other services (17,000).*  
*Information services was the lone category posting a loss, down 10,000.*  
*Service providers accounted for 101,000 of the total, with goods producers adding the rest.*  
*From a size standpoint, all of the growth came from companies with more than 50 employees. Small firms saw a loss, with those employing fewer than 20 workers down by 13,000.*  
*The ADP count comes two days ahead of the Labor Department’s nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show growth of 150,000, following August’s disappointing showing of 142,000, of which 118,000 came from private sector hiring.*  
*While the ADP report serves as a precursor to the official count, the two can differ, sometimes by wide margins.*  
*Federal Reserve officials are watching the jobs numbers closely as they contemplate the next move for monetary policy and interest rates. In a speech Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the labor market as “solid” while noting that it has “clearly cooled” over the past year.*  
*The Fed is expected to follow up its half percentage point rate cut in September with further reductions in November and December. The main question is whether the central bank will move in the same large increment or pivot back to a more conventional quarter-point move.*  
*Futures market pricing currently points to a quarter-point cut in November then a half-point move in December. Powell indicated that consecutive quarter-point moves are the more likely scenario now, though policymakers remain attuned to the data and will adjust accordingly.*",2024-10-02,0.875,Positive,"['ADP', 'ADP', 'ADP', 'ADP', 'ADP']"

"Why ExxonMobil, Conoco Phillips, and Lockheed Martin Rallied on a Down Day for the Markets",1fu94of,JRshoe1997,2024-10-02 11:12:14,23,0.73,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fu94of/why_exxonmobil_conoco_phillips_and_lockheed/,"Shares of oil and gas majors ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Conoco Phillips (NYSE: COP), as well as defense contractor Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), rallied on Tuesday, up 2.8%, 4.2%, and 3.5%, respectively, as of 1:17 p.m. ET, even as the broader indices were down between 1% and 2% at that time.

Fortunately for their shareholders, but unfortunately for other sectors and the world, these critical companies saw their stocks rally as oil prices spiked on news that Iran was launching an imminent attack on Israel.

On Tuesday, a senior White House official said Iran is preparing to launch an imminent ballistic missile attack on Israel. Then at midday, the Israel Defense Forces reported Iran had in fact launched missiles toward Israel. The attack comes after Israel has struck against Iran's proxy army Hezbollah operating in southern Lebanon. In addition, Israel is preparing a limited military operation in southern Lebanon to clear the area of Hezbollah militants.

Given that Iran and other Middle East neighbors are major oil and gas producers, the prospect of a wider regional conflict has the potential to disrupt oil supplies to the rest of the world. This is why both ExxonMobil and Conoco Phillips rallied along with oil prices, which were up nearly 4.5% to $71.25 as of this writing.

Higher oil prices would obviously benefit the top and bottom lines of Exxon and Conoco. Conoco is a pure explorer, but doesn't have significant production in the Middle East region. And though Exxon is more diversified with midstream and downstream assets, it still makes the bulk of its earnings through oil and gas exploration, and therefore benefits when prices rise. Furthermore, Exxon derives most of its exploration from outside the Middle East.

And obviously, whenever geopolitical tensions ramp up, that usually bodes well for U.S. defense contractors' stocks, with Lockheed Martin being the second-largest U.S. defense contractors by market cap.

Lockheed has actually had a tremendous year, with the stock surging over the summer on the back of better-than-expected earnings and more sales of its F-35 fighter jets to more allied countries.

In addition to general geopolitical news, Exxon and Lockheed also received two positive company-specific bits of news today. Exxon received approval from the Nigerian government to sell its Nigeria offshore assets to Seplat for $1.28 billion. Of note, Nigeria has been somewhat of a difficult geography for oil and gas operators recently, due to theft and corruption. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin received a near $3.9 billion naval contract for its Trident missile systems today, in addition to some smaller aeronautics contracts.

Neither news item is tremendously impactful to either company, given the overall size of these industry giants; however, these items were still likely incremental positives.

While oil and gas stocks are out of fashion for many investors, given the focus on climate change and reducing emissions, they do offer a hedge against geopolitical events, such as the one we are seeing today. Remember, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, traditional energy stocks went on to be some of the best performers that year.

So while oil and gas and defense stocks may not be as exciting as high-growth artificial intelligence (AI) plays these days, they do offer benefits in a healthily diversified portfolio. Moreover, most traditional energy and defense stocks also pay decent dividends.

So, today should be a reminder to investors of the role these types of stocks can play, offering hedges against geopolitical disasters, all while paying you growing dividends in the meantime.

"Nike postpones investor day, posts mixed quarterly results as it gears up for CEO change",1fty3mh,Puginator,2024-10-02 01:53:31,163,0.95,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fty3mh/nike_postpones_investor_day_posts_mixed_quarterly/,"Nike on Tuesday said it was postponining its investor day as it delivered mixed fiscal first quarter results.

Here’s how the world’s largest sneaker retailer performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 70 cents vs 52 cents

Revenue: $11.59 billion vs $11.65 billion

Over the last year, Nike has been accused of falling behind on innovation and ceding share to competitors as it focused on selling directly to consumers through its own websites and stores rather than through wholesalers such as Foot Locker and DSW. 

The company announced in September that CEO John Donahoe would be stepping down and would be replaced by company veteran Elliott Hill, who is scheduled to take the helm Oct. 14.

Under Donahoe’s leadership, the company grew annual sales by more than 31%, but it got there by churning out legacy franchises such as Air Force 1s, Dunks and Air Jordan 1s — not the groundbreaking styles that turned the company into a global powerhouse. 

Over the last few quarters, Donahoe has spoken about the need to improve innovation and mend Nike’s relationships with wholesalers, but the company’s board decided that Hill, who spent 32 years with Nike before retiring in 2020, would be the right person to lead its next chapter. 

Donahoe is expected to be present during the company’s conference call with investors Tuesday afternoon, but observers will be keen to see if there are any clues into where the company is planning to go under Hill’s leadership. 

The incoming CEO will need to power up Nike’s innovation pipeline, reset its relationships with wholesalers and improve morale after a series of layoffs and a breakdown in culture. 

Overall, the sneaker market has been relatively stagnant in the U.S. Consumer spending on discretionary goods such as new clothes and shoes has been sluggish, which has made Nike’s situation that much more difficult. 

Footwear sales in the U.S. are projected to grow by just 2% in 2024 compared with 2023 after barely budging between 2022 and 2023, according to Euromonitor. Athletic footwear is expected to grow by about 5.6%, the firm said. 

Nike’s performance has also been weighed down by the uneven economy in China, Nike’s third-largest market by revenue, which will be another key item to watch for in the earnings report. Nike’s performance in China is often an indicator of the region’s financial health, and in late June, it warned of a “softer outlook” in the region. However, China’s central bank recently unveiled its largest stimulus measures since the Covid pandemic, which is expected to give the region’s economy a much-needed boost. 

Nike’s fiscal first quarter would have concluded prior to those stimulus measures, but executives may share color on how sales are performing during the current period. 

Shares of Nike closed at $88.40 on Monday, down about 19% so far in 2024, significantly underperforming the S&P 500′s gains of about 21%.

Challenge to find stocks matching 13 attributes of Peter Lynch,1ftwftk,conquistudor,2024-10-02 00:45:40,34,0.82,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ftwftk/challenge_to_find_stocks_matching_13_attributes/,"I tried to find modern examples to each attribute mentioned in Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street. Then I thought this community could find better fits and have fun together. So please share you candidates for any category below - maybe we discover hidden gems along the way.

RECAP: Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street is  filled with fundamental yet profound strategies.  Invest in simple, easy-to-understand businesses over complex ones.  Identify undervalued companies with stable returns and less competition. And, search for as many of 13 attributes of the hypothetically ""perfect company."" The dream attributes of such a company go as:

***It Sounds Dull—Or Even Better Ridiculous:***

Companies with unexciting or absurd names often go unnoticed and can be undervalued, providing excellent buying opportunities. Lynch highlights that these companies are typically engaged in simple, straightforward businesses and the duller the name, the better the prospects could be.

My examples: Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA) & The Lovesac Company (LOVE)

***It Does Something Dull:***

Companies engaged in mundane or straightforward businesses might not attract attention but often provide stable and increasing returns. Lynch appreciates companies that do boring things as they are less likely to be in the limelight and more likely to be undervalued.

My examples: Waste Management (WM) & Stepan Company (SCL)

***It Does Something Disagreeable:***

Businesses involved in unpleasant industries (like waste management) are often overlooked. Their disagreeable nature keeps them under the radar of most investors, potentially leading to lower valuations and higher returns for those willing to invest in them.

My Examples: Altria Group (MO), cannabis companies and Caesars Entertainment (CZR)

***It’s a Spinoff:***

Corporate spinoffs often result in profitable investment opportunities. Parent companies usually ensure that spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned for success, leading to lucrative investments.

Found a good website on this: [https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/](https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/)

***The Institutions Don’t Own It, and The Analysts Don’t Follow It:***

Stocks with little to no institutional ownership and minimal analyst coverage can indicate untapped potential. These ""ignored"" stocks might offer significant opportunities for gains before they become mainstream.

My examples: Denny's Corporation (DENN) & Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)

***The Rumors Abound: It’s Involved with Toxic Waste and/or the Mafia:***

Lynch points out that companies involved in industries surrounded by rumors or negative perceptions, like waste management or alleged Mafia connections, can offer hidden value. The negative stigma leads to fewer investors and potentially lower valuations.

My examples: **Clean Harbors (CLH)** & Boyd Gaming (BYD)

***There’s Something Depressing About It:***

Companies operating in industries that deal with the less pleasant aspects of life, like funeral services, often have consistent demand and face little competition. They are typically ignored by the larger investing community, providing opportunities for higher returns.

My examples: Service Corporation International (SCI) & Matthews International Corporation (MATW)

***It’s a No-Growth Industry:***

Contrary to popular belief, Lynch prefers investing in low or no-growth industries as they tend to have less competition and more predictable business. The stability and predictability of such industries can lead to steady returns.

My examples: Consolidated Edison (ED) & American Water Works (AWK)

***It’s Got a Niche:***

A strong niche market provides a company with a competitive edge and often a virtual monopoly in its area. Niche companies can control pricing and enjoy high barriers to entry for competitors, often leading to sustained profits

My examples: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) & WD-40 Company (WDFC)

***People Have to Keep Buying It:***

Lynch prefers investing in companies that make essential, habitual or addictive products like drugs, soft drinks, or cigarettes over those making fickle products, as continuous buying ensures steady business.

My examples: Procter & Gamble (PG) & Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY)

***It's a User of Technology:***

Companies that effectively utilize technology to reduce costs or enhance services are appealing. For example, a company benefiting from the technological price war, like Automatic Data Processing using cheaper computers to increase its profitability, is a better bet than the companies making the computers.

My examples: Walmart (WMT) & Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)

***The Insiders are Buyers:***

Insider buying is a strong positive signal. If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.

My examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) & Carnival Corporation (CCL)

***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***

Companies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions​.

PepsiCo to buy tortilla chip maker Siete Foods for $1.2 billion,1ftvztj,Puginator,2024-10-02 00:28:10,435,0.94,102,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ftvztj/pepsico_to_buy_tortilla_chip_maker_siete_foods/,"PepsiCo
 said Tuesday that it’s buying Mexican American food company Siete Foods for $1.2 billion, marking the company’s first food acquisition in roughly five years.

Like many food companies, Pepsi has been trying to shift its portfolio to include healthier options in recent years, usually through acquisitions. Recent additions include Bare Snacks, Health Warrior and PopCorners.


Soon that will also include Siete. Founder Veronica Garza started the company in 2014, when she began selling grain-free tortillas. Since then, its portfolio has grown to include tortilla chips, taco shells, salsas and seasonings, often designed to accommodate different dietary restrictions. Retailers like Target,
Kroger,
 Whole Foods and CVS
 carry the company’s products.

“We look forward to expanding our multicultural portfolio with these incredible products and even more consumers discovering and enjoying Siete,” Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a statement.

The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025, assuming it receives regulatory approval.

Deal-making has picked up this year for packaged food companies, who are turning to acquisitions to drive sales growth as shoppers buy less of their products. In August, M&M’s owner Mars announced it would purchase Pringles parent Kellanova
 in a deal valued at nearly $36 billion. This March, Campbell Soup
 completed its $2.7 billion acquisition of Rao’s pasta sauce maker Sovos Brand.

The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ,1ftqqw0,acg7,2024-10-01 20:53:05,0,0.38,160,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ftqqw0/the_crash_of_the_stock_market_has_arrived/,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|

|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

China's '08 crisis' - Is this the reversal?,1ft4yha,MrJSSmyth,2024-10-01 01:28:08,0,0.32,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ft4yha/chinas_08_crisis_is_this_the_reversal/,"My name is MrJSmyth.

For the last 2 years I have slowly been buying up Chinese equities. Month after month, they fell time and time again. 

As many of you may know, Chinese stocks took a sudden nose dive during Covid. The CCP announced major lock downs, they fined their big tech and took cash from their reserves. They cracked down on many of their private companies including the likes of Alibaba and Tencent just to name a few. Then you had the political divide with things such as a potential war between Taiwan, the spy balloon controversy with the US and also a possible chance of delisting the ADR's off the US stock exchanges just to name a few.

Let's just say it hasn't been a pretty few years. HOWEVER.

One thing I noticed was that their balance sheets never took a nose dive in the way their stock price did. Their economy still grew at 4% near it's lows and even though the housing market was crashing due to the big property developers not being able to finish the projects, China was still growing. Slower, but still growing.

With this information I looked through some of China's biggest names and every 3 months checked in on their earnings and the rest of their balance sheet material. 

It didn't take long to notice that the stocks were not falling due to declining sales but more so due to political interference.

100 years ago no one was buying stocks from Germany, they were public enemy number 1. Now if I could tell you that you could buy some of Germanys biggest companies for pennies on the dollar back then you would do it with 20/20 hindsight. Well, I believed the same thing for China.

So, I begun buying. Over the last 2 years I have bought more that £50,000 worth of stock in Chinese equities, lowering my average each and every quater.

As of the past few months my chinese portfolio has pulled very slightly into the green and we are still so far off the all time highs from the likes of Alibaba and Tencent.

Now I am not saying we will ever reach those highs again or that I won't go into the red again however I do believe that over the last 2 years I have bought at 08 levels and now it appears the Chinese market could be ready to rip. 

Again, this is all opinion and speculation.

My question to you lovely folk of reddit is this. What is your thoughts on the Chinese market and also, if you were around during the 08 period, how did you benefit/get slaughtered by the great crash of 08.

Thanks for taking time to read this piece.

*Key Points*

* *Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Monday that the recent half percentage point interest rate cut shouldn’t be interpreted as a sign that future moves will be as aggressive.*
* *“We are not on any preset course,” he told the National Association for Business Economics.*
* *Powell expressed confidence in economic strength and sees inflation continuing to cool.*

&#x200B;

*Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Monday that the recent half percentage point interest rate cut shouldn’t be interpreted as a sign that future moves will be as aggressive.*  
  
*Instead, the central bank chief asserted during a speech in Nashville, he and his colleagues will seek to balance bringing down inflation with supporting the labor market and let the data guide future moves.*  
  
*“Looking forward, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, policy will move over time toward a more neutral stance. But we are not on any preset course,” he told the National Association for Business Economics in prepared remarks. “The risks are two-sided, and we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.”*  
  
*The remarks come less than two weeks after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee approved the half percentage point, or 50 basis point, reduction in the Fed’s key overnight borrowing rate.*  
  
*Though markets had been largely expecting the move, it was unusual in that the Fed historically has only moved in such large increments during events such as the Covid pandemic in 2020 and the global financial crisis in 2008.*  
  
*Addressing the decision, Powell said it reflected policymakers’ belief that it was time for a “recalibration” of policy that better reflected current conditions. Beginning in March 2022, the Fed began fighting surging inflation; policymakers of late have shifted their attention to a labor market that Powell characterized as “solid” though it has “clearly cooled over the last year.”*  
  
*“That decision reflects our growing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in an environment of moderate economic growth and inflation moving sustainably down to our objective,” Powell said.*  
  
*“We do not believe that we need to see further cooling in labor market conditions to achieve 2 percent inflation,” added Powell, who gave no outward indication of where he sees the next move going.*  
  
*Powell’s assertion that the Fed has not predetermined policy is in keeping with past statements.*  
  
*Futures market pricing is indicating that the Fed is more likely to move cautiously at its Nov. 6-7 meeting and approve a quarter-point reduction. However, traders see the December move as a more aggressive half-point cut.*  
  
*For his part, Powell expressed confidence in economic strength and sees inflation continuing to cool.*  
  
*Inflation during August was around 2.2% annually, according to the Fed’s preferred consumer price expenditures prices index released Friday. While that is close to the central bank’s 2% goal, core inflation, which excludes gas and groceries, was still running at a 2.7% pace. Policymakers usually consider core inflation as a better guide for longer-run trends being that food and energy prices are more volatile than many other items.*  
  
*Perhaps the most stubborn area of inflation has been housing-related costs, which rose another 0.5% in August. However, Powell said he believes the data eventually will catch up with easing prices for rent renewals.*  
  
*“Housing services inflation continues to decline, but sluggishly,” he said. “The growth rate in rents charged to new tenants remains low. As long as that remains the case, housing services inflation will continue to decline. Broader economic conditions also set the table for further disinflation.”*  
  
*Following the speech, Powell was scheduled to sit for a question-and-answer session with Morgan Stanley economist Ellen Zentner.*",2024-09-30,0.9899,Positive,[]
Thoughts on SPYT? Highly ambitious plan or doomed to fail?,1h87crh,OtisB,2024-12-06 23:26:41,1,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h87crh/thoughts_on_spyt_highly_ambitious_plan_or_doomed/,"Hoping someone can shed some light on this. I have an older family member who recently took the advice of his financial advisor and moved about 100k of his 650k savings into SPYT to draw income from that. He told me about this because he wanted my thoughts, and honestly I know so little about CC ETFs that I don't even want to say anything to him. It got me very curious though. The fund plan is to return 20% with no NAV erosion. This seems a whole lot like it's too good to be true - even acknowledging that it may not work - just suggesting that they can return 20% consistently seems almost like heresy to me. Given that 99% of my experience investing is in long term buy/hold until I retire type of stuff, I've googled and read some and I understand WHAT they're doing, just really don't know enough to guess on what that'll mean for investors.

Can someone shed a little light on this particular fund's claim and tell me what they think? I don't own any, and don't plan to own any, I'm just super curious about the idea of DRIP-ing something with a 20% return and no loss of principle and how likely the fund is to succeed.

Why I’m likely to Capitulate and buy Bitcoin,1h86j2c,rifleman209,2024-12-06 22:51:37,0,0.4,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h86j2c/why_im_likely_to_capitulate_and_buy_bitcoin/,"I’m a big fundamental guy with stocks. Hate technicals.

Bitcoin is something I’ve never owned and basically swore off.

With it hitting $100k a coin, it made me think. Okay here is a thing valued at $2-3 trillion with no fundamental value.

It’s totally based on belief, kinda like Santa or whatever. Then I thought about the last 3 years with crypto companies defrauding investors, it tanking and still it came back. 

It just went through probably one of the largest questioning of faith ever and people still believe to the tune of new all time highs.

What could cause an even greater loss in faith than defrauding billions from people? With more regulations coming it will likely better legitimize crypto causing more belief.

Rocks, art and unbuildable land all have value even though they don’t produce cash flows.

Bitcoin is self fulfilling, it has value only because people believe it has value and it seems like that isn’t going to go away anytime soon. Cash in and of itself doesn’t have value, but because we accept it, it does. People are accepting bitcoin more.

If I am going to buy, it will be a small amount each month and DCA rather than allocate a block of my portfolio.",2024-12-06,0.893,Positive,['DCA']

What would you consider a good entry point for bitcoin?,1h85vjq,grave_miscalculation,2024-12-06 22:24:17,0,0.25,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h85vjq/what_would_you_consider_a_good_entry_point_for/,"Bitcoin recently hit a value of $100k, as I’m sure we are all aware by now.

Arguably, bitcoin has been one of the most successful investments over the last 10 years, up there with NVDA and other Mag 7 stocks.

I won’t lie, I’ve been a Bitcoin hater for most of my investing career. It’s tough to conceptualize fully, it has not always been mainstream enough so it’s understandable to be learn of it, and its supports are so ardent and ravenous that it feels like a cult. I don’t blame any skeptics for not putting their money into it.

That said, over the last year or two, it has certainly gained a ton of legitimacy as it has played a significant role in Trump’s presidential campaign and also begun to be an asset that hedge funds are also purchasing.

I, like many others I assume, want to make it a part of my portfolio, but it’s tough to analyze its value because it doesn’t act like your usually security exchanged on the stock market. There are no balance sheets or income statements for bitcoin to look at, and I have no idea if its valuation is way too high or too low.

I can certainly see it continuing to go up in the near to mid term future. If you told me it would hit $200k in the next two years, I wouldn’t be surprised. That said, I also wouldn’t be surprised if it also hit $40k in the next two years too.

Is now a good time to buy? There’s a lot of hype around it after it just hit $100k in value, so I’m nervous about jumping into it right now, but I’m struggling to put together a fair value estimate that I should wait for it to hit before I buy.

What are your thoughts on this matter?

Best use of $200k inheritance,1h84752,No-Eggplant9401,2024-12-06 21:12:27,0,0.3,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h84752/best_use_of_200k_inheritance/,"Hello all, I'm a 39 year old living in the US. I was making $75k/yr up until 3 years ago when it got downgraded to $35k/yr (closure of company due to COVID and I needed/need a job to support the family). I currently own a condo, but have $180k at 4.25% interest rate left on the loan (monthly on that is ~$1.3k and value of home is ~$600k-650k, ~$420k-470k in equity). My monthly expenses average about $4k/mth and I have $90k in the bank (so I am using my net income of $2k/mth combined with $2k/mth from my savings account for expenses). I need to go back to school to be able to make more money, still deciding on what I'm going to do (either nursing or accounting, I am currently in the medical field). Here is where it gets a bit more interesting: I am going to come into an inheritance in the amount of roughly $200k.

I have invested in stocks throughout the years, but am scared of the volatility. I have had familial investment properties that I've managed and that's not what I'm interested in (at least not for the near future). I don't gamble, I like sure things. This is the reason my money is in a regular savings account with BofA earning like 0.0001% interest per year (I know it's useless, but once again to reiterate, I don't like to gamble).

I would like to upgrade the condo to a house within the next 5 years (with the caveat that I understand that with safe investing the $200k will not become $1 million, but I also don't want it to turn into $200,015 in a BofA account).

I know this post is all over the place, but ultimately I want to know what to do with the $200k. Obviously, I need the $90k savings for my day to day until I get up on my feet career wise (which is why I don't really want to invest that), but I want to invest the $200k inheritance. I don't know if I should just pay off my loan, invest in HYSA, bonds, dividends, etc (I know nothing about any investment accounts other than basic savings accounts, CD's, IRA's, I read about Vanguard in another post today and would have to look into that).

Despite strong performance, the stock fell over 10% after hours. As the market said: “Cool, but your Q4 guidance is $0.8M shy of what we wanted, so here’s a **10% drop in your stock price** for your troubles.”

**What Does Samsara Do?**  
Samsara provides sensors and cloud-based software to help manage vehicle fleets and industrial operations. Their Internet of Things (IoT) platform enables GPS tracking, monitors routes, assesses vehicle performance, and now includes cutting-edge AI-powered safety features.

**Earnings Highlights:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 36% YoY.
* **Large Customer Expansion:** Increased share of Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) from large customers ($100k+ ARR contracts).

**So Why the Drop?**  
Apparently, Wall Street got hung up on guidance. Samsara revised its Q4 revenue target to a midpoint of $335M, which is… drumroll… **$0.8M less than analysts expected.**

Yes, the company that just grew revenue by 36% is being punished for rounding down. This modest adjustment led to a **$3 billion market cap wipeout.**

**Why I’m Still Buying:**

1. **Big Moves Up-Market:** Samsara is snagging bigger clients and expanding internationally, showing they’ve got staying power.
2. **Innovation FTW:** Their AI-powered **Drowsiness Detection** (launched in October) uses **38 billion minutes of video training** to spot tired drivers. Yawning? Head-nodding? Face-rubbing? Samsara knows, and they’ll tell you (and your boss). It’s next-gen safety tech that can save lives and dollars.
3. **Consistently Outperforming:** This is a company that has a habit of beating its own guidance. Personally, I’d bet they’ll do it again.

The way I see it, this stock drop is a classic case of Wall Street overreacting to decimal places.  Samsara’s story—international expansion, innovative products, and solid execution—remains intact. I am of the opinion that represents a good buy opportunity of a stock I'm a long term fan of, would love to hear others take on the company and if i missed anything!",2024-12-06,0.9908,Positive,"['IOT', 'EPS', 'GPS', 'AI', 'ARR', 'ARR', 'FTW', 'AI']"

Is there any reason to be invested in a Target-Date fund vs a total stock market index (401k)? ,1h7rxix,Particular-County-83,2024-12-06 08:52:44,66,0.88,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h7rxix/is_there_any_reason_to_be_invested_in_a/,"Is there any reason to be invested in a Target-Date fund vs a total stock market index (401k)?

     $250k balance as of today. When I look at the target date fund vs the Dow or S&P over that same period it’s a huge percentage behind. With that said, I understand that the “value” of the target date fund is also to somewhat protect you from large losses especially as you get older. So two sides this I suppose.

I put in a lump sum (a large amount of my saving money after I excluded emergency money) and plan to DCA monthly.

The reason that my portfolio contains more than 20 stocks is that I want to diversify it in terms of the stocks, not types of assets. 

My concerns/questions are:

1. I'm not sure if I hold too many stocks in the same category (e.g. tech stocks) and most of them are already covered by the IWDA ETF.
2. I'm also considering holding only 1 or 2 high-dividend stocks like AbbVie, instead of 5 dividend stocks. Is it a good idea?
3. My long-term plan follows ""time in the market > timing the market"". So I plan to split DCA in half and put in ETF and stocks equally. I also read about the [Enhanced DCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b40399/enhanced_dollar_cost_averaging/). Statistically, is the Enhanced DCA worth a try?

I go and setup my retirement account through Fidelity, add my bank account and it asks me if I am using a business checking to contribute. I click ‘yes’ and proceed through the prompts. 

Long story short, they want me to send in a form through USPS with all of my business checking and routing numbers attached (no way..) They also want a voided check attached to that form. 

Maybe I’m overreacting, but I feel like this should be much easier than what it is.

There's an article in the Economics forum about commercial real estate woes. By itself it's not the end of the world, but with the gov't debt where it's at, dropping fed rates back to 0 with bank failures won't have the same effect cause bond vigilantes will ramp up the 10 year.

What is this going to do to AI if funding slows? What if they all fall a little bit and that cycle repeats? The biggest safegap seems to be rich people holding a ton of cash, but they aren't necessarily going to 'catch a falling knife'.

To me, the most insulated assets to protect for this seem to be international equity.

Bitcoin isn't speculative and it solves the Byzantine General's problem.,1h7ees2,Standard-Sample3642,2024-12-05 22:51:43,0,0.11,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h7ees2/bitcoin_isnt_speculative_and_it_solves_the/,"I don't know how technical I should get in this OP, but a lot of ""traditional investors"" are still too biased against bitcoin because they don't understand the technology. They are the same kind of people who said don't invest in AMZN because no body will want to buy books on these new fangled ""online stores"".

What is the Byzantine General's problem? It's probably one of those most valuable problems in human civilization, if we were to put monetary value on it. It is a problem where one person can't trust the others in a group. It's typically encountered in complex organizations or where technology requires fidelity (Ai).

So Bitcoin can both enforce fidelity and fault tolerance across the Ai spectrum and across human civilization.

The US DoD also publishes papers on another application of Bitcoin which is cryptography, which is why almost all of the global mining is expectedly split between China, Russia and US, each controlling about 30% share. Because the three super powers recognize that a bitcoin wrapper around data effectively puts a price tag on that data.

Lastly, how does the mining ""subsidy work""? Subsidy is pulled from the white paper, it's not a miner's reward, it's a subsidy.

The subsidy puts a price floor on Bitcoin by ensuring that transaction fees are not prohibitively expensive until bitcoin is large enough to make meaningful transactions.

If we think of the subsidy in terms of bitcoin only then when it first began the transaction fee was something like 50 bitcoin. Four halvings later and it went to 25, 12.5, 6.25 and now 3.125 bitcoin.

So it costs 3.125 bitcoin to transact right now, and is entirely subsidized. Think of transactions as a bank with limited teller windows and you auction aka bid the highest price for use of that teller window.

Transactions take place on the Lightning network and companies like AMZN are building their own Lightning networks which are basically like owning your own credit card company where you take a fee for the use of the credit card. So companies are already branching into this.

So let's recap the technology to see how it's not a speculation at all, it's the next Ai or Internet or etc.

1. It solves Byzantine General's problem solving one of the most valuable problems in human history by allowing Ai and organizations to have fidelity between systems.
2. It is a massive cryptographic engine that puts a price tag on the value of whatever is being protected. A hacker has to spend that much money to defeat the encryption.
3. It has aguaranted floor in price that is inverse-proportional to the cost of the transactions as measured in the Bitcoin subsidy given to miners. The fewer coin used in transaction cost at greater power usage (fiat cost) then the greater the fiat value of Bitcoin.
4. The Lightning network is the off-chain payment method that Bitcoin uses and that generates fees for the operators of the nodes and those fees are like credit card fees generating revenue for the operators of the ecosystem.

If you ever worried about investing in Bitcoin because it's a ""Gamble"", it's no more a gamble than investing in Coca-Cola or a power plant.",2024-12-05,0.986,Positive,"['OP', 'AMZN', 'US', 'US', 'AMZN']"

Lose money on tax deferred account?,1h7d9q9,Ninjaboy8080,2024-12-05 22:04:41,1,0.66,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h7d9q9/lose_money_on_tax_deferred_account/,"Apologies for the vague title. I've come up with a hypothetical scenario, that under my current understanding of taxes/IRA accounts, would mean someone would lose money by using a tax deferred account. My intuition tells me my understanding is wrong, so hopefully someone here could outline how.

Let's say Bob has 1k in cash. He can either deposit it into his tax-deferred traditional IRA or his taxable brokerage account. In both cases, he will use the 1k to buy 1k worth of shares of company A on January 1st 2025. And, in both cases, the value of the shares will be worth 5k on January 2nd, 2026, at which point Bob will sell the shares for that amount. Let's also assume Bob is single, and has an income of 50k/year, and meets the age requirements such that he will not be subject to early withdrawal tax penalties.

Scenario A: Brokerage account

Bob sells the shares on Jan 2nd. He is subject to a long term capital gains tax of 15% on the 4k he made. .15 \* 4000 = 600 in taxes.  

Scenario B: Traditional IRA

Bob sells the shares on Jan 2nd. The sale is not subject to tax, as the account is tax-deferred. He now has 5k in the account. Withdrawing the money will result in income tax, the marginal tax rate of which (for Bob) is 22%. .22 \* 5000 = 1100 in taxes.

I know there are some oversimplifications here, but does this not mean that Bob would lose money by using an IRA over a taxable account in this case? I am not trying to draw conclusions about the effectiveness about taxable vs tax-deferred accounts in general. I understand that early investment can result in large, long-term capital gains that far outweigh what one would pay in income tax.

Capital gains in the taxable are only around $25k, as I recently started non retirement investing, so a lot of that is principle.

I can save $30-40k a year, so that means in order to pay off the mortgage, for the next 5 years I’d have to put every additional dollar I have on the house on top of this liquidation and keeping my funds down at the bare bones $25k level. In 5 years I would essentially have a paid for $500k house and $25k in cash to my name - this all is if I don’t get married and “life happens”. Anything outside of this dedicated plan would add more years to payoff. 

On the other hand, I could keep the $150,000 growing in the markets and keep investing as I have been before taking on this mortgage - And then refinance my loan at a later date.
Technically right now I could have close to $225k invested if I chose to invest everything down to that $25k level instead of using it for the mortgage.

(TSLA) Stock Equity Investing,1h70pbp,Fearless-Gate6303,2024-12-05 09:51:36,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h70pbp/tesla_unveiling_the_overvaluationa_comprehensive/,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has emerged as one of the most polarizing entities in contemporary financial history, boasting a market capitalization surpassing the combined worth of established automakers such as Toyota, Ford, and General Motors. Although the company has undeniably transformed the automotive and energy sectors, our analysis indicates that Tesla's valuation is driven by speculative enthusiasm rather than enduring fundamentals.

This report highlights substantial concerns regarding Tesla's financial performance, competitive positioning, and speculative projects such as the Optimus robot. Utilizing a macroeconomic perspective, it incorporates the Buffett Indicator and Shiller P/E Ratio to position Tesla within a broader market bubble. Our analysis concludes that Tesla is overvalued by nearly every metric, presenting a strong case for re-evaluating investment in the company.

**Disconnect from Fundamentals** P/E and Market Multiples 

Tesla's valuation metrics are inflated to speculative levels, outpacing both its peers and historical precedents: 

**Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio (TTM):** Tesla’s Price-to-Earnings stands at **94.55**, far above the automotive industry average of 5-15. For context, NVIDIA (a high-growth tech company) trades at 62x, and Apple, with its mature, stable business model, trades at 30x. Even against leading tech companies, Tesla’s P/E ratio is disproportionately high. 

**Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:** Tesla trades at 8.95x sales, while Toyota and Ford hover below 1x. By comparison, NVIDIA’s P/S is approximately 16x, justified by its dominance in high-margin, rapidly expanding AI markets. Tesla’s lower-margin automotive business does not command the same pricing power or scalability, making its P/S ratio harder to justify. 

**Enterprise Value to EBITDA:** Tesla’s EV/EBITDA: 81.72, significantly higher than traditional automakers like GM (\~7x) and Toyota (\~6x). 

Tech Companies EV/EBITDA: 

* NVIDIA (NVDA): \~41x (Q4 2024), driven by its dominance in AI and GPUs. 
* Apple (AAPL): \~24x (Q4 2024), reflecting its mature, high-margin ecosystem.

These valuations assume extraordinary growth and profitability far beyond what Tesla has demonstrated or is likely to achieve given intensifying competitive pressures and technological limitations. 

**Current Market Cap to GDP Ratio**: The Buffett Indicator stands at **208%**, indicating an extreme overvaluation of the U.S. stock market. Tesla’s significant influence within major indices intensifies this systemic risk.

**Shiller P/E Ratio Current S&P 500 CAPE:** At 36.5, the CAPE ratio is nearing levels seen before the dot-com bust and 1929 crash. Tesla’s inflated valuation amplifies the broader market distortion. 

**Financial Performance Analysis** 

Revenue Growth Deceleration Tesla’s revenue growth trajectory is losing momentum: Annual Growth Decline: From **51.35% in 2022 to 18.8%** **in 2023**. Quarterly Revenue Stagnation: Q3 2024 revenue of $25.18 billion represents a sequential decline of 1.25%. **Margin Compression** Tesla's once-dominant margins are eroding under competitive and operational pressures: **Gross Margin:** Dropped to **18.25%** in 2023, reflecting price cuts and rising input costs. **Operating Margin**: Declined to **9.19%**, signaling inefficiencies in scaling operations.

Tesla's profitability is heavily reliant on high-margin regulatory credit sales. Regulatory Credit Dependency Tesla earned $1.78 billion from regulatory credits in 2023, representing 1.8% of revenue but an outsized share of net income. As traditional automakers ramp up EV production, the demand for Tesla's credits will wane, threatening this vital income stream. 

Policy Risk: Potential deregulation under a new administration, such as Donald Trump’s rollback of EV mandates, could eliminate this revenue entirely. 

Free Cash Flow Volatility Annual **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: Declined by **42.38%** YoY to $4.36 billion in 2023. CapEx Expansion: **Capital expenditures** surged to **$3.5 billion in Q3 2024**, reflecting heavy investments with uncertain ROI. 

Competitive Positioning: Eroding Leadership Market Share Under Siege Tesla’s once-dominant EV market share is eroding as competitors scale production: 

* BYD (China): Outpaced Tesla in global EV sales with a diversified, cost-efficient lineup. 
* Ford and GM (U.S.): Successfully launching competitive models like the F-150 Lightning and Chevy Bolt EUV. 

Volkswagen Group (Europe): Scaling production of the ID series to challenge Tesla in key markets. Limited Product Lineup Tesla offers only four primary models: Model S, 3, X, and Y. Delays in the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi have limited its ability to address growing demand for EV trucks and commercial vehicles. 

**Technological Limitations: The Autonomy Gap** 

Tesla's reliance on a Level 2 autonomous system, marketed as ""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD), raises significant safety concerns. Unlike its competitors, Tesla has faced public scrutiny and legal challenges over a troubling number of fatalities and accidents associated with its Autopilot and FSD systems. Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is limited to **SAE Level 2**, requiring constant driver supervision. Despite its branding as ""Full Self-Driving,"" Tesla's system lags behind competitors who are deploying higher levels of autonomy. Competitors Advancing in Autonomy 

* Waymo (**Alphabet**): Operating **Level 4** autonomous vehicles in urban and suburban environments, Waymo leverages a robust sensor suite, including lidar, radar, and cameras, to achieve safe, driverless navigation. 
   * Despite millions of miles driven in autonomous mode, Waymo has not reported any fatal accidents involving its vehicles. The company’s use of lidar, radar, and stringent testing protocols prioritizes safety above all else.
*  Cruise (**General Motors**): Similarly deploying **Level 4** autonomous vehicles, Cruise has demonstrated fully driverless operations in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix. 
   * Similarly, Cruise operates its autonomous fleet in complex urban environments without any recorded fatalities. Rigorous validation and oversight underpin its commitment to safety. 

**Mercedes-Benz**: Achieved **Level 3** autonomy, allowing drivers to disengage under specific conditions, and is actively scaling this capability in key markets like Germany.

* As a pioneer in achieving Level 3 autonomy, Mercedes-Benz adheres to strict European safety standards. The company has not been implicated in fatal incidents linked to its autonomous technology. 

**Tesla's Refusal to Adopt Lidar**: A Strategic Misstep Lidar, a gold standard for environmental perception in autonomous vehicles, is absent from Tesla’s sensor suite. While Tesla relies solely on cameras and neural networks, this approach limits its ability to detect objects with the precision and reliability required for higher levels of autonomy. Lidar offers redundancy and reliability in adverse conditions, such as poor weather or low visibility. Tesla’s omission of lidar raises safety and regulatory risks. 

Regulatory Roadblocks: Tesla's current system may struggle to meet the stringent safety standards required for **Level 4 or 5 autonomy**. The Business Model Constraint Tesla's refusal to adopt lidar is not solely technological—it is economic. Adding lidar would dramatically **increase production costs**, undermining Tesla’s ability to maintain competitive pricing in a margin-sensitive market. 

Cost Implications: The inclusion of lidar could add $1,000 to $2,000 per vehicle in hardware costs alone, compressing Tesla’s **already declining gross margins**. 

Reliance on Low Costs: Tesla’s market position **depends on producing vehicles at a relatively low cost**. Embracing lidar and other advanced sensors would necessitate higher vehicle prices or **reduced profitability**—both untenable given Tesla’s current valuation pressures. Tesla Will Struggle to Deliver a High-Quality, Level 5 Vehicle Tesla’s business model prioritizes cost efficiency over technological advancement. This approach limits Tesla’s ability to compete with high-quality offerings from rivals like Mercedes-Benz and Waymo. This makes the realization of a Level 5 fully autonomous vehicle—the holy grail of autonomy—highly unlikely in the foreseeable future. While also ensuring Tesla will continue to deliver lower-quality vehicles compared to competitors who balance advanced technology with rigorous quality standards. Tesla's technological and economic constraints reveal a fundamental flaw in its autonomy strategy. While competitors like Waymo, Cruise, and Mercedes-Benz lead the charge toward true self-driving vehicles, Tesla remains limited by its cost-driven model, prioritizing affordability over technological robustness. This gap will only widen as regulatory demands for safety and precision increase, further eroding Tesla’s competitive edge in the autonomy race. 

**Speculative Ventures: The Optimus Robot and Financial Impossibilities** Tesla’s foray into humanoid robotics through the Optimus project exemplifies speculative spending on unproven technologies. While CEO Elon Musk has branded Optimus as a revolutionary product that will transform industries, the financial and technological hurdles are insurmountable given Tesla’s existing commitments. 

Development Stage: Early and Unimpressive Current Optimus prototypes remain far from market ready. Demonstrations reveal robots controlled remotely, lacking the autonomy necessary to perform even basic tasks reliably. Musk has claimed Optimus will perform functions ranging from warehouse labor to elder care, yet no substantial evidence supports the viability of this vision in the near term. 

Competition: Boston Dynamics’ Atlas Robot: Years ahead in functionality and autonomy, Atlas showcases capabilities like complex navigation, load handling, and task performance, including construction-related activities. Tesla lags far behind established players like Boston Dynamics, whose decades-long focus on robotics has yielded tangible results. 

Optimus, in its current form, appears more akin to a marketing spectacle than a functional product. 

Tesla’s ability to deliver a viable Optimus robot, while maintaining profitability and fulfilling its other ambitious promises (such as Level 5 autonomy), faces significant financial constraints: 

**High Production Costs**: The estimated Bill of Materials (BOM) for Optimus is $50,000-$60,000 per unit, with components like robotic hands costing upwards of $10,000 alone. Scaling production to mass-market levels without compromising profitability would require unprecedented efficiency improvements, which Tesla has not demonstrated in its automotive business. 

Lack of Focus: Tesla is already grappling with **slowing vehicle sales**, **declining margins**, and the **high capital expenditure needed for its core EV business**. Simultaneously pursuing **Level 5 autonomy** and **humanoid robotics** is **financially and operationally unsustainable**. The Conflict Between FSD, Vehicles, and Optimus Tesla’s current valuation assumes success across multiple frontiers—producing low-cost vehicles, achieving full Level 5 autonomy, and scaling humanoid robotics. However, these goals are mutually exclusive given Tesla’s financial and technical limitations.

Level 5 Autonomy Challenges: Achieving this milestone requires heavy investment in lidar or other advanced sensor technologies that Tesla has eschewed to preserve margins. Without these investments, FSD remains stuck at Level 2, far behind competitors. 

Vehicle Profitability Risks: Tesla relies on cutting costs in its automotive production to maintain competitiveness. **Diverting resources** to **Optimus** would further strain vehicle **margins** and **reduce its ability to compete** in the increasingly crowded EV market. Successfully building Optimus at scale would demand massive R&D expenditures, high production costs, and extensive testing—placing further pressure on Tesla’s finances. 

Financial Risks to Shareholders Elon Musk’s vision for Optimus, paired with Tesla’s ongoing promises of Level 5 autonomy and affordable EVs, creates a trifecta of expectations that cannot be achieved simultaneously.

Investor Dilution Risk: Funding these speculative ventures may necessitate raising capital, diluting shareholder equity further. **Profitability at Risk**: Optimus development would drain resources needed to maintain Tesla’s **fragile profit margins**, which have already been compressed to **18.25%** **gross** margin in 2023. Credibility Concerns: Years of missed deadlines on promises like Level 5 autonomy raise doubts about Tesla’s ability to deliver on Musk’s bold claims, tarnishing investor confidence over time. **Tesla’s Optimus robot is emblematic of the company’s speculative spending and overpromised vision.** The inherent financial impossibilities of simultaneously scaling Optimus, achieving Level 5 autonomy, and maintaining vehicle profitability underscore a fundamental flaw in Tesla’s business strategy. 

Unlike its competitors, Tesla is spread too thin, risking operational focus, financial stability, and shareholder value. As Musk continues to promise breakthroughs, **the gap between reality and rhetoric only widens, making Tesla’s lofty ambitions increasingly untenable.** Operational Challenges Quality Control Issues Tesla continues to face manufacturing defects and recalls: High Recall Rate: Frequent recalls, including software glitches and mechanical failures, have raised concerns about **production quality.** Customer Complaints: Limited-service centers and long repair times **undermine Tesla’s brand reputation**. Tesla’s competitors have prioritized safety, employing rigorous testing, comprehensive sensor suites (including lidar), and conservative rollout strategies. This stark contrast underscores the risks of Tesla’s cost-cutting approach: **Inventory Build-Up** Tesla’s days of inventory increased to **28 days** in Q3 2024, suggesting weakening demand relative to production levels. 

Tesla has historically been a leader in electric vehicle (EV) battery technology, notably with its high energy density and efficient thermal management systems. However, competitors are rapidly advancing, challenging Tesla's dominance in this critical area. Competitors' Advances in Battery Technology 

* BYD's Blade Battery: BYD's Blade Battery utilizes lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, offering enhanced safety and longevity. Its thin, blade-like design allows for higher energy density and improved space utilization within the vehicle. 
* CATL's Qilin Battery: Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) has developed the Qilin battery, which boasts a record-breaking volume utilization efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg. This enables longer driving ranges and faster charging times. 
* Solid-State Batteries: Companies like Toyota are investing in solid-state battery technology, which promises higher energy density, faster charging, and improved safety over traditional lithium-ion batteries. 

Tesla's introduction of the 4680 battery cells aims to **reduce costs** and improve vehicle range. These cells are larger and designed to be integrated into the vehicle's structure, enhancing efficiency. However, **production challenges have delayed their widespread implementation**, allowing competitors to narrow the technological gap. 

**Impact of Rising Lithium Prices** The EV industry is heavily reliant on lithium, a critical component in battery production. Recent trends indicate a significant increase in lithium prices due to supply constraints and escalating demand. **Lithium carbonate prices have surged, reaching unprecedented levels.** This escalation is attributed to the rapid growth in EV adoption and limited expansion in lithium extraction and processing capacities. Supply Constraints: The **International Energy Agency (IEA) warns of potential lithium shortages by 2025**, which could hinder the scaling of EV production globally. Implications for Tesla Cost Pressures: **Rising lithium prices directly impact battery production costs**. For Tesla, which aims to produce mass-market EVs at competitive prices, these **cost increases** could **compress profit margins** or necessitate higher vehicle prices, potentially reducing demand. 

Tesla's ambitious production targets may be jeopardized by lithium supply bottlenecks, leading to potential delays in vehicle deliveries and an inability to meet market demand. While Tesla remains a significant player in the EV market, its lead in battery technology is being challenged by competitors' innovations. Coupled with the financial pressures from rising lithium prices and potential supply shortages, Tesla faces substantial challenges in maintaining its competitive edge and profitability in the evolving EV landscape. 

**Legal and Regulatory Risks** 

* **Autopilot Investigations**: Multiple NHTSA probes into Autopilot-related accidents could result in costly recalls or fines. 
* **Misleading Marketing Claims:** Lawsuits alleging false advertising of Tesla’s FSD capabilities pose reputational and financial risks. Tesla’s valuation is built on speculative optimism that diverges significantly from its financial and operational realities. The company faces a convergence of critical challenges: 
* **Slowing Revenue Growth and Margin Compression**: Revenue growth has decelerated, while declining gross and operating margins highlight the financial strain of maintaining competitive pricing amidst rising costs. 
* **Reliance on Unsustainable Revenue Streams**: Regulatory credit sales, a key driver of profitability, are vulnerable to policy changes and decreasing demand as competitors ramp up EV production. 
* **Technological and Strategic Constraints**: Tesla’s Level 2 autonomy lags far behind competitors like Waymo and Cruise, who have deployed Level 4 solutions. The company’s refusal to adopt lidar reflects cost-driven compromises that limit its ability to achieve higher levels of safety and autonomy. 
* **Speculative Ventures:** The Optimus robot project exemplifies Tesla’s foray into high-risk, unproven technologies. Building and scaling Optimus while pursuing Level 5 autonomy and maintaining profitability is financially and operationally implausible. 
* **Eroding Market Position**: Tesla’s dominance in the EV market is waning, with competitors like BYD, Volkswagen, and GM offering cost-effective and innovative alternatives that threaten Tesla’s market share. 
* **Safety and Reputational Risks**: Fatalities linked to Tesla’s Autopilot underscore the dangers of overpromising and underdelivering, contrasting sharply with the safer, more transparent approaches of competitors. 
* **Challenges in Battery Technology**: While Tesla has historically led in battery innovation, competitors like BYD, CATL, and Toyota are closing the gap with advanced technologies like the Blade and Qilin batteries, as well as solid-state innovations. Production delays and scaling issues with Tesla’s 4680 cells further erode its competitive edge. 
* **Rising Costs of Key Commodities**: The surge in lithium prices and potential shortages of critical materials like cobalt and nickel threaten to increase production costs and compress margins. For Tesla, which relies on aggressive pricing to sustain demand, this adds a significant financial burden. 
* **Macro indicators such as the Buffett Indicator (208% of GDP) and the Shiller P/E Ratio (36.5)** place Tesla’s valuation within the context of broader market overvaluation, further amplifying the risk of a correction. 

Tesla’s ability to sustain its valuation assumes simultaneous success in producing low-cost vehicles, achieving Level 5 autonomy, and scaling speculative projects like Optimus—all while maintaining profitability and navigating intensifying competition. This multifaceted challenge is not only improbable but also exposes shareholders to significant downside risk. 

As competitors advance technologically, diversify product offerings, and secure more efficient supply chains, Tesla’s vulnerabilities become increasingly evident. Combined with macroeconomic pressures and systemic overvaluation, Tesla’s stock is poised for significant correction, making it a high-risk holding for investors.

Seeking Advice: Stock Sale or Margin Loan/HELOC for Home Renovation,1h6vbhi,mikeygomikey,2024-12-05 05:30:32,0,0.5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h6vbhi/seeking_advice_stock_sale_or_margin_loanheloc_for/,"Live in Bay Area and we bought a house in 2020 (locked in a 3%). Thankfully our mortgage was affordable for us but last year's promotion meant going to fixed salary and no longer receiving company's overtime pay. Promotion meant my ""salary"" went up $20k but no longer getting OT meant actually taking a $50k cut. (120k went to 140k but actual take home was 190k now down to 140k).  
Salaried positions get RSUs which help offset pay loss and, in a few years, my pay increases should start to bring me back up to last year's take-home. Basically we're now in the ""house-poor"" group. We're thankful for our situation but understandably this requires a lot of budgeting.

With that background here's our situation:  
We really want to remodel our house. For what we want to do I'm estimating $150k budget (kitchen, bathrooms, interior, exterior, adding doors, moving windows, floors, etc...). Our neighbor recently did a similar remodel for $75k but I think he had a connection with a few contractors. I don't have final quotes yet and our budget will help us determine what is a priority. 

I could pay for all of this if I sold some company stock but, this stock traditionally does really well and last 5years saw a 200+% return.  So if I sell this stock then I'm missing out on future potential returns, essentially making this remodel perpetually more expensive. 

Alternative is something like a Margin Loan or a HELOC. I'd be able to fulfill our reno budget with a margin loan and keep our LTV pretty low.   
The problem with taking a loan (like HELOC) is that we would need to sell stock to make the payments. If we're using the stock as leverage for a loan then selling stock to pay the loan, is that any better than just selling stock to buy what we need? The only benefit I could see is feathering the stock sales over time to leverage as much gains as possible, compared to selling it all now.

Having contractors coming in soon to start quotes and give timelines. I'll need to have a finance plan in place soon.

That is $45k emergency fund. The S&P500 return 28% this year. You basically lost $13,800 because you held it in cash.

Does it really makes sense to hold 12 months of expenses? Instead why would you not just buy an index like VOO in a taxable account. If you do need quick cash you can sell VOO.

Sure there are times you might have bad timing. But the market is up much more often than down.

I have been keeping an emergency fund for years. And so far I never had to tap much into it. I must have lost tens of thousands of lost returns.

I’m 19 years old and currently studying for a B.Sc. in Information Technology. A few months ago, in September, I started experimenting with stocks and learning the basics of investing. Since then, I’ve gained a lot of knowledge, and my interest in investing has grown significantly. Now, I want to begin investing consistently to build long-term wealth for my future self.

During this ""trial phase,"" I experimented with various stocks and baskets, and here’s what my current portfolio looks like:

* **14.2 shares** of a distributing S&P 500 ETF
* **€500** in the WisdomTree Core ETF
* **€1,429** in a self-made AI/Tech basket

My current plan is to simplify my portfolio. I’m considering selling the entire WisdomTree Core and AI/Tech baskets and reallocating that money into the S&P 500 ETF. My reasoning is that I want to focus on lower-risk, long-term investments to future-proof my money.

To execute this, I was planning to sell the profitable (""green"") stocks first and wait for the unprofitable (""red"") stocks to recover before selling them.

I chose the distributing S&P 500 ETF because I plan to reinvest the dividends in riskier investments later to explore potential higher returns. (Don´t mind the 1€/day, that's just some testing I did)

Additionally, I’ll be receiving €2,500 from my company soon. I’m unsure how to allocate this new capital. Should I invest it all into the S&P 500, diversify further, or take a different approach?

What do you think about my strategy? What could I improve or do differently? I’d really appreciate any advice or insights from more experienced investors. Please feel free to educate me!

Thank you in advance! :)

Should I dump my investments to cover the mortgage?,1h6bohu,serpro69,2024-12-04 14:19:10,3,0.6,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h6bohu/should_i_dump_my_investments_to_cover_the_mortgage/,"Hi all!

I have a dilemma that I can't figure out myself. I don't know if I should come here for advice, or I'm just as good asking chatgpt, seeing that everyone's situation is personal and in the end you're risking your own money, so any advice should be taken with a grain of salt? But here it goes anyways, maybe someone will at least give me things to think about.

Me and my wife (both in our late 30s) just took a loan for an apartment. After repaying the loan + regular expenses we'll be left with around \~20% of the combined monthly income. At least half of that we plan to put into extra repayments on the loan, the rest just putting aside for any potential larger expenses in the future.

In 2022 we were searching for a place to buy also, but didn't find anything at the time, and ended up investing that. It's mostly invested in a fund tracking MSCI global index, and a small portion in a fund tracking a US tech-focused index.

The initial plan for this investment was for it to be our ""retiremend fund"". But now I'm thinking if we should instead use that to repay part of the mortgage (it should cover \~40% of the loan).

The reasons I'm thinking about this:

1. I really hate loans (so much so, that this is in fact first time ever I'm taking any kind of credit in a bank). With the loan amount and everything, it just looks quite painful to pay so much in interest back to the bank.
2. I'm quite concerned about all the insanity that's happening in the world... don't know what the future holds of course, but worse case I think I would regret more not repaying the loan than loosing some potential extra returns
3. The market seems overvalued, but I'm never going to pretend that I know what's going to happen there of course...
4. Having also a bit of a dislike for ""virtual money in a bank"" that can just disappear one day, I'd rather put it into something more tangible, get rid of a lot of interest that we'd otherwise be paying to the bank, use the freed up expenses to repay the remainder of the loan faster, and then maybe also invest a bit monthly for retirement.

If I look at rough numbers, and considering we won't be investing extra anytime soon, using a calculator with an average return of 8.2% on MSCI index over the next \~20-25 years, then I can see that any gains we make off of the current investment - we'll be pretty much paying the same amount in loan interests over the same course of time.

Am I being a bit over-dramatic about my reasons to use the investment to re-pay a chunk of a loan and taking this decision because of emotions? Or does it actually make sense to use our current investments to repay the mortgage?

>!Some numbers:!<

>!\- investment (200k invested, \~280k now total with returns before tax)!<  
>!\- UPD: apart from the fund investments we don't have much of other savings for retirement or anything else. Everyone here has a ""mandatory"" retirement account that your employer pays to based on your salary and government regulations. But that's quite small in any case.!<  
>!\- mortgage is split into two loans (320k with 5.34% interest + 380k with 5.45% interest; the latter can be re-financed via our bank with which we have the first loant; plus I'm thinking if we eliminate 300k of the debt, the overall interest they will give us will be slightly lower than 5.34)!<  
>!\- UPD: I forgot to mention that the interest rate for the loan is floating, so it could also go either way... But for simplicity sake I'm just looking at a fixed point.!<

[Here is a great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/s/nWkCPmqJSp) on some examples of those things.

What seems like a great option is instead of using a HYSA, I just put all of my savings into a brokerage account and buy either USFR or SGOV. Maybe SGOV since rates are currently falling, and SGOV’s rates *shouldn’t* fall as quickly as USFR. The most recent dividends that these US Treasury ETFs have paid amount to about 4.5% per year with 0.09% expense ratio for SGOV and 0.15% for USFR.

Liquidity isn’t a huge issue for me vs HYSA since trades should settle T+2 and I can transfer to one of my bank accounts to get cash if I need it. But I worry that there’s somehow more risk to this than having the money safe under FDIC rather than SIPC in the brokerage account.

For financials, is it right to think of them as middlemen? Companies that do debt financing for all the other sectors in part using equity generated by investors? 

Countries, particularly less economically dominant ones like South Africa, tend to have financials make up about 40% of their market cap (of the ETF). Is this like a middleman sheltering equity holders from the ebbs and flows of their countries economic see saw?

The last few years, I’ve saved starting from nothing to $125k in my high yield savings and put another $100k in a taxable brokerage invested in stocks. I owe $200k on my mortgage starter home at 3.75%. 

The place I’m in is probably only for the next year to 3 years, maybe 5. 
My question is, should I be investing future money or allotting funds to my high yield savings account?

I ask this because let’s say I buy a house in a year or 2 and I get a 6-8% rate, I’d likely want to pay as much into that as possible, and future surplus money would go on the house. If I were buying a house today with those rates, I’d be tempted to liquidate all $100k after tax stocks and dump everything on the house. If I were going to do it now, why wouldn’t I want future funds liquid and ready to do that? 2-3 years from now isn’t really a long enough time horizon to have any after tax money invested if all is supposed to go on the house. Should I liquidate all of the $100k in stock now with that rationale? Only downside is that until $500k is saved (price of next home) in cash, there wouldn’t be any non retirement investing taking place. ",2024-12-04,0.6416,Positive,[]

My portfolio is currently split 50/50 between Amazon stock (from RSUs that vested over five years ago) and a mix of high-growth ETFs and total market ETFs. I’ve been considering reducing my position in Amazon, but I’ve been hesitant due to the 15% capital gains tax.

Since retirement is over 25 years away, my plan is to reinvest in high-growth ETFs like QQQ or VUG. While these ETFs still have a significant exposure to Amazon, they would provide more diversification than my current concentrated position.

I'm a fairly recent immigrant to this country (36m) so started my retirement/ savings from scratch in my early 30's. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast, making around 100-150k/ year running my own business as an S corp, where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60% of my income, which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business.

My main expense is rent and utilities, other than that I have no other debt (paid off car, no student debt) aside from small credit card bills (under 3k that I pay off monthly- no interest)

  
**Current Accounts and Savings:**

  
Personal Checking Account- $3k, keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account- salary in, bills out.

Business Checking Account- $20k, this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow, I usually try to keep it around $20k- thinking I could/ should move at least 50% into an account that accrues some interest. 

SEP IRA (Deductible)- 25k, I max out the contribution yearly, 25% of my w2 income (started this in 2022) I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That's it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum?

ROTH IRA- 18k, Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI (50%) VOO (40%) and 10% cash.

M1 Investment Account- $3k, started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, V, LLY  etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out.

Regular Brokerage Account- $1.5k, use this for the occasional weekly/ monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400-500 per month from this account, so most months i don't even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account.

Chase Investment Account- $14k, $400 monthly contribtions, this was a Chase Auto Invest account (mid risk) that yielded about 10%, so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80% invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market, i'm thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline.

  
Crypto- $20k, been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy.

  
So my currently contributions to all my accounts are :

  
SEP IRA- 1k monthly DCA into VTI  
ROTH IRA- $500 monthly DCA into VTI/ VOO  
M1- $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks  
Chase Invest- $400 monthly DCA into money market  
Crypto- $400 DCA into BTC  


I don't really ever sell stocks or funds, unless they become seriously overweight, or I need the cash, which hasn't happened so far.

I'm fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly, just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach, or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don't worry too much about market movements, I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper.

They're in the process of selling their company and will probably pocket $250K USD after taxes if the transaction is successful.

They don't really have any savings or liquid assets to their name now, but do have about $25K worth of credit card debt from starting the company that they'd like to get rid of.

My friend has been a DN for a while and wants to invest the $250K with the goal of retiring as early as possible on a monthly budget of $5000 USD post tax. They figure that will be good enough to live anywhere in LATAM, AFR or SEA for a while, which is their preference.

The acquiring company will give them a role that pays $100K post tax for 2 years, and my friend plans to save about 40% of every paycheck they receives. What happens after that is anyones guess, but my friend is trying to figure out if they should be investing in stocks, crypto, real estate, hospitality businesses or something else to maximize their chances of retiring in the next 10 years.

Yet, it now trades at *historically low multiples*: EV/EBITDA of 11x compared to its 5-year average of 21.5x.

A few reasons why the market is bearish:

* Weak sales in China and sluggish Travel Retail recovery
* Shrinking margins, impairments on acquisitions and withdrawn guidance
* Dividend cut and new leadership changes

But here’s the flip side:

* Estée Lauder has a portfolio of iconic brands (Estée Lauder, Clinique, M·A·C, La Mer, Jo Malone).
* Travel Retail and China (\~50% of revenue) may be down but aren’t out, with long-term growth potential still intact.
* The global beauty market is projected to grow at a 6% CAGR through 2028, with the prestige and luxury tiers-Estée’s sweet spot-expected to outpace at 7-9%.
* The Company set a Profit Recovery and Growth Plan, which aims to rebuild margins, cut costs, and optimize operations over FY25 and FY26

Given its *discount* to peers like L’Oréal, does Estée Lauder represent a **buying opportunity today**? Or are the challenges too big to ignore?

I’d love to hear your take:

* Is the market underestimating EL’s recovery potential?
* Does the valuation provide enough margin of safety?

Investing to build a house,1h55b62,c4lder0n,2024-12-03 02:17:01,3,0.64,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h55b62/investing_to_build_a_house/,"I'm discussing with my girlfriend the idea of saving money to build our own house.

* We estimate that the house will cost 800,000 PLN (Polish currency).
* We'll save 6,000 PLN per month.
* Initial contribution: 75,000 PLN.
* Inflation: 3%.

The cost of the house and our monthly savings will likely vary from year to year. For now, let’s assume I’ll need to save for the next 10 years to accumulate the necessary funds.

What’s the best way to save this money? I’ve been considering investing, but it turns out to be more complex than I initially thought. The rate of return could either allow me to buy the house a few years earlier or delay the purchase by a few years.

Which financial instruments would be best for this purpose? I know I could take some risks and invest in stocks or ETFs, but I’m working on a strategy that would allow me to do this in a safer way rather than taking on too much risk.",2024-12-03,0.935,Positive,"['PLN', 'PLN', 'PLN']"

Objective: Maximize monthly dividend generation through a diversified portfolio, reinvest dividends, and maintain a cash reserve to mitigate risks and ensure contributor payments.

1. Strategy Composition

Distribution of Initial Capital

	•	85% in Dividend-Producing Assets: A diversified mix of high-quality assets that generate monthly dividends.
	•	15% in Safe Assets: Investments in low-risk, stable products like bonds or other conservative funds.

Asset Allocation (85% of Initial Capital)

	1.	Real Estate Investment: A portion of the portfolio is allocated to real estate-based assets known for regular dividend payouts.
	2.	Energy Sector: Another portion is invested in energy infrastructure, providing reliable income through dividends.
	3.	Healthcare: Investments in healthcare-related assets that offer consistent returns.
	4.	Technology/Telecom: A selection of technology and telecom assets providing monthly dividends.
	5.	Industrial Assets: A portion is invested in industrial sectors known for stable and predictable dividend payments.

2. Cash Reserve

	•	Capital Allocated: 500 CAD
	•	Interest: Generates 2.25% annual interest.
	•	Purpose: The reserve is used solely for paying monthly interest to contributors, maintaining the stability of the strategy.

3. Contributors

	•	One-Time Loan: Each contributor provides a fixed amount per period.
	•	Interest Rate: Contributors receive 10% annual interest, paid monthly from the cash reserve.
	•	Repayment: Contributors are repaid at the end of the agreed period, either through stock sales or reinvested dividends.

4. Dividend Reinvestment

	•	Goal: To maximize long-term growth.
	•	Process: All dividends generated are reinvested into the portfolio, increasing the capital base and generating more monthly income.

5. Potential Gains from Asset Sales

	•	If needed, assets can be sold to ensure payments to contributors.
	•	Surplus: Gains from asset sales are used to cover interest payments or repaying contributors without affecting the strategy’s growth.

6. Benefits of ECFA Strategy

	•	Stable Dividend Income: A diversified portfolio with monthly dividend payouts.
	•	Scalable: The strategy grows with more contributors, increasing the overall dividend income.
	•	Risk Diversification: Combining high-yield assets with safe investments reduces market risk.
	•	Flexibility: The cash reserve ensures contributor payments, even in volatile market conditions.

7. Risks

	•	Market Risk: Asset values can fluctuate, impacting the performance of the strategy.
	•	Liquidity Risk: The need to sell assets in volatile markets could result in lower-than-expected returns.
	•	Contributor Risk: If contributors withdraw early or dividends underperform, the payment schedule could be affected.

8. ECFA Strategy Rating

	•	Profitability: 9/10
	•	Risk: 7/10
	•	Scalability: 8/10

Overall Rating: 8/10

This strategy leverages a mix of reliable, dividend-generating assets and a cash reserve to maintain stability while growing capital over time. By reinvesting dividends and ensuring contributor payments through the reserve, ECFA is a flexible, scalable, and profitable approach to fund growth.",2024-12-02,0.9972,Positive,"['ECFA', 'CAD', 'ECFA', 'ECFA', 'ECFA']"

When I was in the US, I just invested directly in ETFs. Denmark has mark to market taxation on ETFs/Mutual Funds so before moving I liquidated my ETFs and set-up SMAs through JP Morgan. 

The active nature of SMAs is resulting in significant realised capital gains (for which I owe the Danish govt 42%.) My goal for this portfolio is wealth creation and ideally I'd like to buy and hold and not experience capital gains for the next 3-4 years while I'm in Denmark. Denmark doesn't tax stock holdings from a mark to market perspective, like they do ETFs/MFs.

With that background, a few questions

\- I need to work through the math, but unless my SMA is significantly outperforming the index, I don't see why its beneficial for me to go with an actively managed portfolio. Does that sound right? I need to figure out the breakeven point

\- I'd like to try and get close to mimic-ing the index, by buying stocks directly and just holding them vs. actively managing the portfolio. Can I just buy 30-50 stocks across the globe and then just hold to get close to the index? Are there tools I can use to mimic this? 

I'm willing to give up some of the gains by using this strategy, vs. realising gains and paying substantial taxes. What else am I missing? Would appreciate further thoughts on this front. Thanks so much.

I've always been good with what little money I've had, but my toxic habit is hanging onto it in my savings accounts because I never had enough to invest and let go of long enough to accrue any interest or growth (i.e. paycheck to paycheck life & on my own since 16). I always needed an emergency fund, which would be depleted ever couple of years during a crisis. Despite this, my credit has taken a massive hit due to some poor decisions, and I am finding it almost impossible to recover from, even if I paid off all of my debt, which would leave me with no safety net.

  
I've had a corporate job for nearly 3 years now, which comes with a 401K. At first, I was only contributing 5% because that's as much as my employer was matching. They stopped matching for about a year, then started back up again this past July. So my return is currently around +17% with a high risk profile. 

It occurred to me recently that this is all pre-tax contributions, and while I'd take home less if I contributed more, my untaxed savings would grow exponentially while I was taxed less on lesser take home pay.

  
I've accrued nearly $14k in my time with the company and recently changed my contributions to 10%. However, I am seeking a way to cash it out and put it somewhere where it will double, triple, whatever in a shorter period of time, and I am willing to take the 10% tax penalty to do so - if it's worth it.

So my question to you savvy investor members is - have you ever cashed out your 401K, and what did you do with it in order to have your money make you more money? Possibly even navigating the economy in such a way that your money ended up working for you so well that you were able to retire on a passive income.

  
Is this possible? Do I have enough to do something like that? What are your suggestions? Should I roll it over? Are there opportunities I am unaware of and missing out on? Any and all feedback is welcome. ",2024-12-02,-0.9076,Negative,[]

So my question now is, is this a smart move for any of your investments? Maybe just some of the riskier ones that might pop off? Or is this just paranoid thinking?

Does this strategy make sense,1h4ax13,Shoddy_Ad7511,2024-12-02 00:45:01,7,0.63,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h4ax13/does_this_strategy_make_sense/,"Currently my portfolio is 70% VOO and 30% SGOV. Before last week I was 100% VOO. But like many others I feel the chance of a significant drop (over 20%) in the next year could happen. Not saying it’s guaranteed to happen. Wild guess is about a 30% chance of a 15%+ drop in 2025.

Another factor is I’m a few years away from retirement. 

Here is the strategy I plan on implementing. At the current market sentiment I will keep my portfolio at 70/30 stock. Almost all of my portfolio is in IRA/Roth. So buying and selling won’t cause a taxable event.

If stocks continue to go up I will sell some VOO and buy SGOV so my ratio stays at 70/30

If stocks drop 10% - I will sell some SGOV and buy VOO so my allocation is 80/20

If stocks drop more to 20% - I will sell some SGOV and buy VOO so my allocation is 90/10

If stocks drop more to 30% - I will sell some SGOV and buy VOO so my allocation is 100/0

I could adjust this to be more conservative (wait to buy till 20% drop) but I’m not hunting the bottom. I just want to be able to buy VOO at a discount if a 10-30% drop happens. If it drops more to 40-50% then fine. But probability shows it is much more likely it will drop 10-30%.

Does this strategy make sense? I’m not trying to maximize growth (100% stock) or trying to time the bottom (wait till full 30-50% drop to buy VOO)

Or am I trying to time the market too much. I will say if I retire in 5 years and I’m 100% stock, it would suck if the market drops 40% that year. So I’m trying to protect myself but still trying to grow the portfolio ",2024-12-02,-0.7783,Negative,"['VOO', 'SGOV', 'VOO', 'IRA', 'VOO', 'SGOV', 'SGOV', 'VOO', 'SGOV', 'VOO', 'SGOV', 'VOO', 'VOO', 'VOO']"

It automatically put me int a state street target date fund. Looking at the other options and reading what most people say it seemed like I would be better off with the S&P 500 State Street fund so I switched to 85% of future contributions going to that and 15% to the tdf. It has a lower expense ratio of .02 instead of .09 and better returns over every time period shown. Then I was reading about how that is probably redundant because the tdf also has S&P 500 in there already. So I found a mid cap fidelity fund with a .025 expense ratio and better returns over every period shown than the tdf and switched so the 15% going the the tdf would now go to fid mid cap. After both these changes I read things making me question my decision. One was somebody saying they don't know why anyone would ever invest in mid cap lol. I was thinking about changing it to 80% S&P 500 10% fid mid cap and 10% small cap. I don't know if that is better.

A Second or Third Revisit of Why Warren Buffet May Not Have Fully Understood TSLA When He Said Value is Equivalent to the Whole Car Industry,1h4063m,SevenDeMagnus,2024-12-01 15:34:38,0,0.06,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h4063m/a_second_or_third_revisit_of_why_warren_buffet/,"Hi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. 

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).

Tesla is not just a car company, it's more than that- its an energy company (generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it ""ate it's own cake too"" as they say, it creates the products, the batteries to facilities that energy charging service), it's an A.I. company, solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w/ Elon's leadership, there's a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere (just like again, EV as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the Model S and the Models after that).

Let's be honest the overvaluation is due to people having strong feeling for Elon Musk not bcs the company has an economic moat.

So the question we need to ask ourselves is: will the postive sentiment end at any point in the near future and honestly I do not think so.

My company offers ESPP with RSU match instead of a discount that vests immediately upon grant.

Even with the 20% RSU, this seems like a huge gamble due to the volatility of the stock, and I may be better off putting this into a HYSA or even an index fund, but I wanted your take to see if I might be missing anything.

This year of very strong performance notwithstanding, I'm looking at the charts and struggling to find any point at which gold would not have yielded a solid and reasonably low risk return over the last 25 years over a 3-4 year investment period.

With the exception of the drop off in mid 2012 (recovered by 2014) there havnt been any significant price falls in that period. The returns over the last 2-3 would have been in the same region as the S&P500 and with commodities taxed at a lower rate than ETFs where I live the difference in net profits would be minimal, this with a added benefit of security it gives in balancing other assets during market uncertainty.

What am I missing? Because the temptation to drop a few grand into gold rather than it sitting in the bank account withering away is nawing at me.

* Being an hedge against my stocks ETF in the (rare) case I need to pull out my money from my portfolio despite I have an emergency fund too. In this case I will have the freedom to choose what I want to sell
* Having a small, but non-zero appreciation of my capital.

Being 100 the value of the intended allocation to bonds what I thought is
* 33 for 0-2y maturity bonds which could be covered with a money market ETF
* 33 for 2-5y maturity bonds
* 33 for 5-10y maturity bonds

I think this allocation grants me increasing exposure to mid/long term bonds which are historically decorrelated to stocks. I will also have exposure to short term bonds which are not volatile.

When choosing where to invest funds in an IRA vs a ROTH IRA, what account would you prioritize for bonds vs stocks?

Hypothetically, lets say you have $100k to invest split evenly between ROTH and Traditional IRA.

You have a broad target allocation of 70/30 stocks-to-bonds so you're looking to buy $30k in bonds.

Would you:

A) Keep allocations the same 70/30 across the board splitting the $30k total bond investment equally, $15k, between tIRA/rIRA with stocks making up the other $35k in each account

B) Optimize towards more bonds in the Traditional IRA (60/40) and stocks in the ROTH IRA (80/20) splitting the $30k total bond investment $20k tIRA and $10k rIRA with stocks making up the other $30k in the tIRA and 40k in the rIRA

C) Optimize towards stocks in the Traditional IRA (80/20) and more towards bonds in the ROTH IRA (60/40) splitting the $30k total bond investment $10k tIRA and $20k rIRA with stocks making up the other $40k in the tIRA and $30k in the rIRA.

My managed accounts are currently optimized towards C and I'm of the opinion B is a better option since the stocks tend to be higher growth.

For about half of my portfolio, I use an investment strategy that seems to be working pretty well!

I call it the 30% off plan (but that is just an average).

Basically, I look for big companies that pay dividends and have dropped around 30% or more in the past 5 years.

(This does not include companies that pay crazy-high dividends).

This has worked out really well. Here's a few examples:

* MMM (started buying at $80).
* VFC (got in at $13 got out at $21).
* INTC (got in at $25 and out at $45).
* PFE (still piling into PFE).

I typically keep a few shares instead of selling the whole position.

I would also like to point out that I allocate a good portion of my portfolio to bonds and ETFs, so I'm not risking all my cash on this strategy.

Do y'all think this is an effective investment strategy?

Here is a thesis for investing on a lump sum amount using S&P 500 but in different flavors,1h37iek,blueskyeagle1908,2024-11-30 13:07:16,0,0.14,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h37iek/here_is_a_thesis_for_investing_on_a_lump_sum/,"Mandatory disclaimer, long time lurker, first time poster. So kindly be gentle.

I am recently going to get a low 6 figure amount as part of Employee Deferred Compensation Plan, after working close to 1.5 decades at my last job. I want to do the following with this capital:

50% - VOO(or other similar fund), 30%  - VGT(or other similar fund) and 20% - UPRO/TQQQ (or other leveraged bull SP500 funds)

I dont think I am doubting my first 80%, but the last 20% in [UPRO](https://www.etf.com/UPRO)/[TQQQ](https://www.etf.com/TQQQ) is what my thesis is really about. The idea of investing in SP500 is that historically it has performed decade over decade steadily and surely. If thats the case, a leveraged SP500 should also go up, with much higher return. If I dont really have an emergency during a bear market, and stay invested, I should be fine. What am I missing?

$UMAC: figuring FMV and the future of warfare,1h32dgn,bionista,2024-11-30 07:56:22,0,0.48,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h32dgn/umac_figuring_fmv_and_the_future_of_warfare/,"Last Saturday, Fox prints this piece.  [https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-scrambles-drones-shape-landscape-war-future-here](https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-scrambles-drones-shape-landscape-war-future-here)

Then on Sunday, Elon tweets this [https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1860574377013838033](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1860574377013838033)

Then on Wednesday, it is announced that Don Jr joins the board of UMAC here [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/27/unusual-machines-shares-soar-donald-trump-jr-joins-advisory-board.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/27/unusual-machines-shares-soar-donald-trump-jr-joins-advisory-board.html)

So what the hell is UMAC (Unusual Machines).  It is an absolutely tiny non-factor of a consumer drone maker located in a warehouse in Orlando.  Prior to the election, it had a flatlining stock trading around $1.50 and a market cap around $12M.  Then post election, the stock began rising suddenly with a number of large insider purchases.  Then with the announcement of Don Jr, the stock has soared to near $20 and a market cap of around $150M.  What's the hidden agenda.

Well, Don Jr. is a smart (i.e. opportunistic) man.  The war in Ukraine has shown the world that land wars are obsolete.  Your $10M Abrams tank can be neutralized by a single drone and a grenade that costs less than $500.  Infantrymen are obsolete.  They can be hunted mercilessly 24 hours a day by drones, day and night, rain or shine, in the trenches, in holes and tunnels, around corners, remotely using thermal vision.

Drones can only be defended by physical means (basically AI controlled counter-drones and bulelts).  Electronic jamming can be effectively countered with electronic shielding.  See this excellent video by Mark Rober.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrGENEXocJU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrGENEXocJU)

Drones are the future of warfare.  We will not need people.  We will not need bombers.  We just need someone with a suitcase of drones able to infiltrate within a few miles of a desired target, release a couple drones with explosives, and the target is wiped out.  No need to send in a $2B B-2 bomber equipped with a $250M worth of bombs to take out the target.  $20,000 of drones in a suitcase will suffice.  Imagine also if that suitcase can lay their dormant and be opened remotely as needed to strike any target in the area.

Drone warfare and terrorist strikes are coming to a place near you.  Sadly.

Lastly, the US DoD spends nearly $2T a year ($1.99T to be more exact).  This is clearly a level which is unsustainable, especially with the rising cost of debt service (yes, the Fed will need to engage in QE3 or 4 or 5 to prevent federal insolvency).  Spending cuts will need to happen.  And DoD with its bloated, irrational spending will be the primary targets.  It has to be.

You see, the Trump administration is dismantling the entire NeoCon apparatus.  Elon and Vivek, along with JD and Hegseth (maybe) and Tulsi and RFK2 (the Trump Avengers) are all zealots of the anti-establishment, anti-neocon, anti-war agenda.  I will bet you a nickle that they will chop trillions (as Vivek targeted $2T) in federal spending, starting with Elon's target the F-35.  Military strategy will evolve from enormously expensive concentrated single pieces of power (F-35, aircraft carriers, B-2, Abrams) to inexpensive fleets of cheap drones a la the Nova Corp.  [https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Nova\_Corps?file=NovaCorpsInBattle.png](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Nova_Corps?file=NovaCorpsInBattle.png)

These drones are nearly indefensible.  And they will be controlled by AI (buy NVDA).  This is the future of war.  And probably the doom of civilization.  It will not be AI that kills us off.  We won't make it that far.  Rather, we will kill ourselves off using AI-controlled drones to fight our wars.  The country with the smartest, fastest, and most drones wins.  We can strike every nuke silo simultaneously and defend our cities and facilities with a dome of drones.  The US not only has to defend its soil, but also that of its allies across the world.  It is hard to imagine how many drones the US military will need.  But lets try.

It is estimated that Ukraine is using 10,000 drones a month.  That is 300 a day.  This just on a small battlefield (only a 600 mile front-line!), capacity constrained military, using Generation 1 human-operated drone tactics.  Imagine having to defends tens of thousand critical facilities across the world at all times from a terrorist attack.  Imagine having to be prepared to fight a Drone World War all run by AI.  These systems would be able to control thousands of drones at a time.  We are talking many millions of drones for basic readiness (all operated by NVDA-driven AI).

So lets say the US military will prepare to fight a war globally on a front that is 100X the 600-mile front in Ukraine.  This may be low given the literally thousands of targets it will need to defend.  The battlefield is not contiguous.  And lets say AI war will use 50X (definitely low) the drones of human-operated war.  This is a 50M standing-army of drones required for defense (10,000 x 100 x 50).  That is for just 1 month of war.  Let's say the US military needs an 18-month stockpile.  That is 900M drones, lets call it 1B to simplify the math.  At say $200 per drone, that will cost $200B (about the cost of 2.5 F-35s to put that in perspective).

Lets say there is an attrition rate of 20% per year due to training and replacement (5-year life expectancy).  That is 250M replacement drones needed per year.  That is $50B for replacement drones.

This is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than developing and maintaining high-tech weapon systems and soldiers.  The savings you can achieve by reducing the number of infantry and high tech jets and ships and tanks, replacing them with drones are massive.  Enough to bail out the US federal debt!  Sure this change won't happen overnight, but it is happenings as we speak thanks to Ukraine.

So what does this all have to do with UMAC?  Well, it is perfectly positioned to ride the wave of this coming military revolution.  It has the anti-neocon son of the future president on its advisory board and from what I can tell, he is also a very significant shareholder in the company.  There is no way this deal was just put together in the past few weeks.  It had to be in the works for months subject to Trump winning the election.  Which then triggered new stock issuance by UMAC, DonJr's investment, and his ascension to the board.

The CEO of UMAC is a guy named Allan Evans.  You can hear him here back in July 2024 talking about focusing on military contracts and the need for NDAA-complaint manufacturers.  They are focusing on being an NDAA-compliant parts supplier to the drone market.  These guys know they can't make the sophisticated AI drones that the military will need.  But they sure as hell can supply the drone parts.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAQjqQyyCzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAQjqQyyCzQ)

At a $150M market cap, this thing is ridiculously underpriced relative to where it should be after proper hyping.  I think the market is still trying to figure it out.  You can't value it on current fundamentals.  It is just the shell company for DonJr (and thereby Trump) to profit off the coming drone military revolution.  Just like Truth Social was/is for DonSr.  The future of drone warfare has arrived.  UMAC is positioned as the domestic NDAA-compliant part supplier.  With DonJr, it is the supplier of choice.  I don't know if there is another NDAA-compliant drone parts supplier out there (probably not given that it's mostly all been made thus far in China), UMAC has the pole position with DonJr as the driver.  It just takes a few introductions and investment dollars in manufacturing capabilities (Elon can help with that) for UMAC to be awarded (directly or indirectly) purchase orders.  If you are a defense contractor hoping to win a bid, would you not include as part of your proposal some business directed to UMAC?

If even 5% of military drone spending makes it through to UMAC, that is $10B in revenue to build the standing army, and $2.5B a year ongoing.  Assuming a 10% net margin, that is $1B in profits on the stockpiling and $250M a year for replacements.  And if there is a US-supplied war somewhere, then it would be even higher.  Ignoring stockpiling revenues and valuing it only on the replacement revenue, at a reasonable 20X PE ratio, this is a $5B market cap company.  That is 33X from current levels.  If they are targeted to achieve that in 10 years, then that implies a current FMV of $1.2B which is 8X from the current $150M market cap or about a $160 stock price.

Think $1.2B is an absurd hype valuation?  Let me introduce you to the psychedelic and weed stocks of a few years ago.  And also the countless biotech stocks that may someday enter into a Phase 1 trial.  And with those stocks, you could not build a case for their valuations.  It was just hype and blind-buying.  UMAC actually has a story and a path towards much bigger things.  And someone named Trump.",2024-11-30,-0.9941,Negative,"['UMAC', 'UMAC', 'AI', 'US', 'JD', 'AI', 'NVDA', 'AI', 'AI', 'US', 'US', 'AI', 'NVDA', 'AI', 'US', 'AI', 'US', 'US', 'UMAC', 'UMAC', 'CEO', 'UMAC', 'NDAA', 'NDAA', 'AI', 'UMAC', 'NDAA', 'NDAA', 'UMAC', 'UMAC', 'UMAC', 'UMAC', 'US', 'PE', 'FMV', 'UMAC']"

I'm wondering if the list of tickers that I picked per category looks right. Maybe I can simplify it to less tickers? Maybe we can be more aggressive?

Likewise there's also a case of not wanting to put all my eggs in one basket.

When looking at returns the US alone is either double or triple the rest of them though, so even if the returns halved overnight they'd still be on top. Meanwhile a small downturn in the other markets could practically wipe out all their gains.

I get Buffett's picks which are first en masse, second they are consumables, 3rd they are simple to make and simple to consume so the turnover for them to make them again is faster(nothing hard in making gum and softdrinks once perfected and there's nothing hard about chewing and drinking Coke), 4th don't require R and D at some point, I call them en masse consumables. But we have to define consumable, it doesn't have to stop with one person, it can go on to almost forever with the next generations.

Having said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it: it's en masse, everybody needs to commute, driving's one's self is convenient, it's consumable in a way coz' you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually (also energy is bought from Tesla via the superchargers among other things) and there's always new graduates to buy them, 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it's as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum (automation + now w/ A.I.), 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there's not much further R and D (especially with A.I. helping with a vehicle's physics and material science).

ECFA is an innovative strategy that combines personal loans from trusted individuals with disciplined investment in ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) to generate growing passive income. It leverages external capital effectively to build wealth while managing risks.

How it Works

	1.	Initial capital: Start with your own investment in low-risk ETFs with a proven track record of dividends.
	2.	Collaborators: Borrow from friends or family, offering them a 10% annual interest rate, paid in monthly installments. The typical term is 5 months.
	3.	Loan investment: Use the borrowed funds to purchase more shares of the same ETFs, increasing both your capital and monthly dividends.
	4.	Loan repayment: At the end of the term, sell enough shares to repay the initial loan while retaining any capital gains.
	5.	Dividend reinvestment: Reinvest all generated dividends to maximize compound growth.

Example in Practice

	•	Initial capital: 6,000 CAD generating 62 CAD/month in dividends.
	•	Year 1: You secure 5 collaborators contributing 2,000 CAD each, totaling 10,000 CAD.
	•	Interest payments: You pay 1,000 CAD in total interest over the year from your own funds.
	•	End of term: You sell shares to repay the 10,000 CAD loan, keeping any capital gains.

By repeating this cycle annually with new collaborators, you accumulate more capital and increase your passive income.

Benefits

	•	For the investor:
	•	Boosts your dividend flow without relying solely on personal funds.
	•	Retains capital gains when ETFs appreciate.
	•	Scalable: Adding more collaborators accelerates portfolio growth.
	•	For collaborators:
	•	Earn a competitive 10% return within a short time frame.
	•	Low risk for them, as they only lend capital and don’t invest directly.

Risks and Mitigation

	1.	Market volatility:
	•	Risk: If ETFs lose value, you might need to cover the shortfall yourself.
	•	Mitigation: Diversify into multiple low-risk ETFs with a strong track record.
	2.	Collaborator trust:
	•	Risk: Losing credibility if payments aren’t fulfilled.
	•	Mitigation: Maintain clear records and honor all payments on time.
	3.	Liquidity risk:
	•	Risk: Reinvesting all dividends may limit cash availability.
	•	Mitigation: Keep an emergency fund to address unexpected expenses.

Conclusion

ECFA is a powerful strategy for building a growing stream of passive income using loaned capital as leverage. While it carries moderate market-related risks, its scalability and compound growth potential make it an attractive alternative to traditional banking products. With proper management and diversification, it can provide long-term financial independence, benefiting both the investor and the collaborators.

Why Healthcare sector is an “Overweight” for me,1h2g40h,kmmeow1,2024-11-29 12:33:09,11,0.69,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h2g40h/why_healthcare_sector_is_an_overweight_for_me/,"
Healthcare Sector Underperformance:
Despite the S&P 500 gaining nearly 5% in November, healthcare stocks have lagged. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) is down 2% this month. While healthcare stocks face near-term policy uncertainty, long-term growth and undervaluation make them a potentially lucrative investment.
Donald Trump’s nomination of healthcare skeptics, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to key positions has heightened investor concerns. Skepticism surrounds potential changes in vaccine policies and regulations, creating uncertainty. Yet, established protocols and institutional inertia within agencies like the FDA and CDC may limit the extent of changes he can implement. Career officials and existing regulations could act as checks on drastic policy shifts. Significant policy changes, especially those affecting public health, could face legal challenges and public opposition, potentially delaying or blocking implementation.
While Kennedy’s nomination signals potential shifts in healthcare policies, the actual impact will depend on several factors, including the confirmation process, institutional checks, and public response. If confirmed, his influence could be substantial, particularly in areas aligning with his long-held views. However, systemic constraints and potential opposition may moderate the extent of his impact.
Healthcare stocks are trading at a valuation of 17.8x forward earnings, lower than the August level of 19.9x, representing the cheapest levels of the year. Analysts suggest this may present an attractive entry point if regulatory fears subside.
Healthcare fundamentals remain strong, with revenue growth expected to climb 11% in the next year. Margins are in the 93rd percentile historically, signaling robust performance relative to other sectors.

I have been DCA'ing into VOO and VGT for a little over a year and a half now.

(This was where my problems started, my portfolio shows +23% and so I assumed that was my returns over long term) I was happy, so started my investing journey. I had a realization a few days ago... Investing calculators use interest, and ETF's do not... They use dividends. And from my understanding, for dividends to make any difference at all, you really need millions already invested.

So my question is... With only 25k currently invested, is there any benefit to continue to DCA into ETF's or should I look into other investment strategies for set and forget (well auto DCA and forget lol)?

I know there's more I want to ask but not sure how to ask it. I thought what I was doing was a good investment strategy but I'm not sure anymore.

Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving,1h28t5b,HearAPianoFall,2024-11-29 05:14:37,576,0.85,261,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h28t5b/talking_with_my_dad_about_nvidia_over_thanksgiving/,"My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.

As Charlie Munger said:*""The whole damn system is corrupt... everyone wants easy money, fast. And that requires a big fee.""*

Think about it: there’s **$2 trillion** locked in mutual funds charging **2% fees** while underperforming cheap index funds like the S&P 500. Who’s really winning here? Hint: it’s not us.



# 2. Temperament beats intelligence

Investing isn’t about being the smartest—it’s about controlling your emotions.

* Warren Buffett: *""The most important quality is temperament, not intellect.""*
* I read a study of a fund that averaged an **18% annual return**, but the **average investor in that fund lost money** because they tried to time the market.

**Lesson:** Fear and greed will destroy your portfolio faster than any bad stock pick.



# 3. The S&P 500 is your cheat code

Here’s your free investing hack: **buy the S&P 500 and chill.**

* Low fees.
* Decades of growth.
* Outperforms **98% of funds** consistently.

Even Charlie Munger admits:*""Wealth managers have almost zero chance of beating an unmanaged index like the S&P.""*

So why do people chase stock-picking glory? Because too many investors confuse excitement with success.



# 4. Picking stocks is really hard

Think it’s easy to find the next Tesla? It’s not. And even if you do, good luck getting in before the hype.

* Buffett: *""If you can’t value the stock, you can’t invest in it. You can gamble on it, but you can’t invest.""*
* Most people buying stocks have never even read a balance sheet.

**Picking winners is possible, but it’s incredibly hard—think Charlie Munger-level hard.**

  
**What this all means**

The truth is, the game is rigged for most people to lose. But that doesn’t mean you can’t win.The winners aren’t the ones chasing hype stocks or flexing their ""10-baggers""—they’re the ones quietly compounding wealth by staying disciplined and focusing on what works: **consistency, patience, and a solid strategy.**

So, how does this match up with your experience? **What lessons have you learned the hard way?**",2024-11-29,0.9685,Positive,[]

Paying off the Mortgage instead of investing for growth ?,1h213zj,Effyew4t5,2024-11-28 23:00:09,0,0.23,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h213zj/paying_off_the_mortgage_instead_of_investing_for/,"Can someone please explain the focus on paying off the mortgage either as quickly as possible or before retirement?

I’ve bought 4 houses and a vacation condo selling all but the 4th house which I live in and bought 2.5 years ago 

In each case I took out a 30 year mortgage at the best rate available at the time 

My monthly payment ranged from a little over $1,000 to the current $3300

When I sold house #3 after 20 years, I still cleared enough to pay cash for the current house. But, I put down just enough to get a 2.75% mortgage and put the rest into my brokerage account (mostly NVDA & PANL). Now, combined with what was already in the brokerage account and the IRAs, we have a bit over $6M which easily generates over $10k/month - when including social security and small pension is around $20,000/month

I fail to see how we could have acquired this much $ had we accelerated or house payoff

I would like to hear reasoning for paying off the house as my son is asking me for financial advice and I think my system has worked well. Is it a factor of time and luck?

The other thing we are doing that appears to contradict my reading is we are drawing on the IRA money first instead of the brokerage account money. I’m doing this for 2 reasons 1. Keep RMDs (in two more years) from being greater than we need- putting us potentially in higher tax bracket (and Medicare costs) and 2. My son will have to liquidate the inherited IRA within 10 years (more potential taxes) while he can do whatever he wants with stocks at the stepped up basis.  Again, why is this not the generally preferred approach?

Need help understading right issues,1h1twog,Moochiberico,2024-11-28 16:54:08,1,0.6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h1twog/need_help_understading_right_issues/,"Hey everybody, hope you're doing fine, and happy thanksgiving to those celebrating it!! (Here in Spain we sadly dont)

  
I'm still on the learning stage, and came across the concept of ""right issues"" thought I had understood it properly. However, when I jump to see some up-to date examples on the real market, I got very confused. 

  
So my understanding is that there is a date called ""ex-rights date"" (Correct me if I'm wrong) which is the last date when shareholders can accept the right issue, then after some days-weeks the new shares will jump on the market and the price will adjust to the new volume.

  
So the point here is that as I understand it, there is no profit on buying shares between the ex-rights date and the date when the new shares are introduced, right? Because you are buying shares which will go inevitably go down in price when the price adjust. 

The thing is that I saw the Atos situation, the ex-rights date was 25Nov and the date that the new share will be introduced will be 10 dec +/-, but after 25Nov a lor of people have been buying their shares and I dont understand why because they cant benefit from the right issue and their shares will go down when the new shares are introduced in the market? So, to those looking to invest, wouldnt be more logical to wait till the price adjustment happens and then buy the shares at a lower price? What am I missing here?

But there's a fascinating paradox at its core that I haven't seen discussed enough.

**The Paradox**

Traditional stores of value (like gold) became valuable because they were naturally stable. Bitcoin is trying to do this backwards - it was engineered to be a store of value before achieving stability. Here's the problem: a currency needs stability to be useful, but Bitcoin won't stabilize until it's widely used.

This creates a chicken-and-egg problem:
- People won't use it as a currency until it's stable
- It won't stabilize until there's widespread usage
- But widespread usage requires stability...

**The Investment Case**

When you buy Bitcoin, you're betting on it eventually solving this stability paradox. If it succeeds in becoming the global store of value, the upside is massive. Consider what capturing even a fraction of these markets would mean:
- Global gold market ($12.5T)
- Government forex reserves ($12T)
- Institutional treasury reserves
- Corporate balance sheets
- Sovereign wealth funds

Is MicroStrategy’s Strategy Innovative Financial Engineering or Something Riskier?,1h1jp1n,jamaciandeliveryguy,2024-11-28 06:14:19,0,0.29,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h1jp1n/is_microstrategys_strategy_innovative_financial/,"I’ve been digging into **MicroStrategy** (Ticker: MSTR) and its bold strategy of going all-in on Bitcoin—positioning themselves as a “Bitcoin proxy.” They’ve adopted a pure-play approach, using billions in low-interest convertible bonds (sometimes at 0%) to fund [massive Bitcoin acquisitions](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microstrategy-makes-record-breaking-bitcoin-084042808.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAITnZfmYGc_hWsrAN9TW9btBfpMrT9l2sRgYV8tpd7i45PIcC4TW-MJ3ueqnXfglWEfcmQcNnQ15Qmb7BuliSKOkcsKRCHddLb-Suzh5O4HYTg-smdaf-cAKHFWuvsJheahdS1ymmBC5ZPgNZSba489qkPOS17jX9j3lV_8aJzuk).

From what I understand, MicroStrategy sells stock volatility to convertible bondholders, who profit from the “Gamma game.” Meanwhile, retail shareholders often see it as a straightforward Bitcoin play, which seems to leave them exposed to significant downside risks, like dilution and price drops. Bondholders, on the other hand, are protected with senior claims and hedged positions.

I’m curious to hear your thoughts:

1. Could this model collapse if Bitcoin’s price or market volatility drops significantly, given its reliance on continuous capital inflows?
2. Do you see this as a clever piece of financial engineering—or is it closer to something riskier, perhaps a pyramid scheme....?

For context, I’ve looked into a few sources that break this down in more detail:

The opinion was:

> The issue with decentralized cryptocurrencies is that they are fundamentally, worthless. Bitcoin did not become more desirable between today and yesterday. Nothing has caused that movement other than arbitrary changes in supply and demand. So why does it change in price at all? Because people want to make more REAL money, and holding onto Bitcoin has proven to be a viable approach (until it isn’t). Nobody really wants more Bitcoin, they want more dollars, and they believe that holding onto Bitcoin will get them more money. 

> The theory is that the supply of Bitcoin is finite, meaning it can only go up. This almost makes sense. But this doodle I drew on a paper is also finite, that doesn’t mean it has value. For the theory to make sense, this substance needs to be desirable for reasons that aren’t just “someone will pay more for this in a few years” because what happens when you run out of people that want to buy in. You get stuck with a worthless bag.

> While nobody is directly running a pyramid scheme (with mainstream coins), the idea of how profit is made is similar. To make a profit, you need a continuous stream of buy ins despite offering 0 product. Unlike with a company stock, you are buying part of a functional business that generates a profit or has the potential too. Same for real estate or any other investment. Your purchase may be purely to get more dollars, but there are multiple valuation metrics of stuff like this based on real world revenue and profit potential through real operations.

> Some argue that decentralized crypto will replace government regulated money. No, it never will. Centralized government regulated crypto can be a thing, but a decentralized coin causes various challenges such as taxes (meaning the IRS will never want decentralized crypto adoption), government controlled inflation, and stability. Government administered crypto can be a good substitute to physical currency but it will likely be far too many years before that takes off.

I've been diving into way too many YouTube videos a lot of (Mark J. Kohler’s channel) about where to start putting retirement funds as a self-employed individual, with an overload of information I don't know if I'm any further with my knowledge. 

Here’s my situation:

* I just turned 34 and have been running my own business for six years.
* For the first five years, I made heavy equipment purchases that provided significant tax deductions, leaving little room to contribute to retirement. Excess cash was reinvested into scaling the business.
* In 2024, I no longer have those large write-offs and don’t foresee major purchases for a while. As a result, my tax bill is projected to be $35-40k this year.
* I roughly have $40K today that I would put toward retirement. 

# Steps I’ve Looked Into So Far:

1. **HSA (Health Savings Account):**
   * I wish I’d started this sooner.
   * I currently have a marketplace PPO plan but wanted to switch to a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) for December to use the “last month rule” and make a 2024 HSA contribution. Unfortunately, I learned this requires a qualifying life event to change plans outside open enrollment, so my HDHP won’t begin until January 2025.
   * I plan to max out the $4,300 contribution for 2025, but this won’t help reduce my 2024 tax burden.
2. **Solo 401(k):**
   * This seems like a logical next step to reduce taxes and begin building retirement savings.

# Additional Notes:

* I haven’t set up an S-corp yet. The main reason is that I’m planning to build a garage-house in 2026 and want to avoid complicating my tax returns for loan qualification. Once the loan is secured, I’ll likely switch to an S-corp.

# My Questions for You:

1. What would you prioritize to maximize tax savings and begin retirement funding for 2024?
2. Are there other strategies or accounts (besides an HSA and Solo 401(k)) that I should be considering?

I recently decided to switch my account to Fidelity, to a self manage brokerage account. Everything transferred over smoothly, didn't have t sell anything as there were to proprietary UBS funds. 

UBS made me a really conservative portfolio, that's' my fault because I told them I didn't want to take losses.



I have 2 options with fidelity:



 Option 1: my plan was to go self managed and have a 4 fund portfolio: 60% US total market, 20% international total market, 10% growth and 10% Bonds. The problem is that what was transferred from UBS is a mess of ETFs and asset allocation is really bad with 42% bonds! So obviously I have to rebalance for a more aggressive portfolio. 



Option 2: I have a call next Dec the 2nd with a fidelity advisor about the benefits of going with a fully managed account (they're the ones who called me and I agreed to listen to them), the highlights are fees of 0.3- 0.7%, and tax loss harvesting. He said that with what with they can save me with tax loss harvesting, etc, they can beat the market by 1%, but i don't if I believe that.



Questions:

If I go with option 1, based on my positions (attached), would I have to sell a lot and buy the funds I want and create a big tax event? Or can  trade ETFs so I don't take big tax hit? My first step is to convert about 32% of my bonds to stocks. Would rebalancing be a panfull prcess? is my 4 fund portfolio plan okay?: 60% US total market, 20% international total market, 10% growth and 10% Bonds. Any recommendations? I think I can ride a stock market downturn, hopefully (see numbers below).

Or should I go with option 2 (fully managed account) and tell them to go aggressive a let them do their thing? Would  this be more beneficial in my case? 



Some context that can help with answering questions:

\- $550k portfolio, I max out 401K and Roth IRA every year, will contribute to the rest to brokerage account every paycheck. 

\-  $30k emergency fund, Only debt is $800 a month mortgage (60k balance). I'm not a big spender.

\- 40y/o, thinking about retiring at 55, I currently have $300k (in 401k and Roth IRA). $120Kk salary.

I currently have a chunk of my Roth IRA in FBTC (Fidelity Bitcoin Fund). I took advantage years ago in getting into GBTC (prior to the SEC ETF approvals). After the approvals, I ended up selling (at a tiny loss) the GBTC and moved those funds into FBTC, probably $14k worth, when it was around $35.  I've since weekly contributed to it and my avg basis is around $44.  FBTC is currently trading around $83 due to BTC hovering around $95k.  I am long on BTC, however I am currently up around 88%.  I have a smaller amount in MSTR with an avg basis of $100, and that is up over 250%.  

I've read before ""take out your initial investment to freeze profits"".  So in my FBTC scenario, does that mean when I feel like pulling the trigger I'd pull out $14k...under the assumption I think  there will be a pullback at some point..in which case I'd buy in at the lower amount (let's say $70-75 ish). 

So this sounds like it would raise my cost basis from $44 to probably near 70, yes? I'm just trying to understand the appropriate way one should 'take profit' when it comes to investing.

I followed a strict buy and hold strategy up until now, but wanted to spice things up a little by introducing swing trades with a small % of my portfolio. As I read through various strategies and derivatives, something came up my mind and I wanted to see if my logic is flawed here.

The idea of swing trade was made with limit buys and limit sells. But as time went on, I read about options, specifically writing options. So now, instead of using limit sells and limit buys, isn't it obviously better to write cash secured puts and covered calls options with the anyway desired strike price? This way, you get the same strike price as a limit order, but as long as the strike is not met, you earn premium.

Is there any flaw to this logic? Am I overlooking something?

-I thiiiink I remember that these funds are scheduled on maturity (6-12 month terms?). Correct me if I’m wrong. How would I get (hopefully grown) money out of the fund, and what are the tax implications? 

-is this one of those things that only works with large holdings?

Question AEG Model vs Residual Earning Model,1h0ne4x,Ok_Time_8815,2024-11-27 03:00:10,2,0.6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h0ne4x/question_aeg_model_vs_residual_earning_model/,"Dear Community,

I'm actually working on Penman's Financial Statement Analysis and Security Valuation (self-study) on the Residual Income Model and the AEG Model.

I think I understood the Residual Earning Model well enough to use for my own Valuation pruposes, but the AEG Model is giving me some sort of confusion, especially when i compare the calculated values of both models in comparison.

In one drill exercise i have to calculate the AEG and Residual Earnings for IBM using the following data:

Required Rate of Return: 10%

Book Value of 2010: 18.77 $/share

2011:

Earnings per Share: 13.22$  
Dividend per Share: 3$

2012:

Earnings per Share: 14.61$  
Dividend per Share: 3.3$

After that the growth will be 11% for both the EPS and DPS in the next 3 years..

When i calculate everything I receive the following data:

Residual Earnings: 2011: 11.34 $/share

Residual Earnings: 2012: 11.71 $/share

Residual Earnings: 2013: 12.19 $/share

Residual Earnings: 2014: 12.71 $/share

Residual Earnings: 2011: 13.3 $/share

AEG 2012: 0.368

AEG 2013: 0.479

AEG 2014: 0.524

AEG 2015: 0.587

So i can actually prove, that the change in residual earnings equal the difference in AEG.

But when i calculate the intrinsic value things get confusing for me.

In both Valuation-Models i would discount the calculated numbers accordingly by (1+0.1)\[t\] and add the value with either Book Value of 2010 for Residual Earnings or with EPS of 2011 for the AEG Model.

The last thing i have to do is divide the result of the equation in the AEG model by the capitalization rate of r to get my value per share.

I double checked my calculations and got a valuation of 58.37 with Residual Earnings and of 147.45 with the AEG Model. I know, that actually I havent used a continuing Value for both models, but this shouldnt explain the huge difference based on these numbers. Did I do a mistake in my calculations or in the formula or what do I miss?

I hope someone may be able to help me.",2024-11-27,0.9951,Positive,"['AEG', 'AEG', 'AEG', 'IBM', 'EPS', 'DPS', 'AEG', 'AEG', 'AEG', 'AEG', 'AEG', 'EPS', 'AEG', 'AEG', 'AEG']"

Speaking of which, DJT is truly remarkable. Since the beginning of 2024, it has raised a staggering $2.66 billion, making it the SPAC company with the highest fundraising amount. 

The second highest in the SPAC space is Lotus Technology,（NASDAQ：LOT） which raised $1.35 billion. Moreover, Lotus has demonstrated rapid growth. In the first three quarters of 2024, Lotus reported total revenue of $653 million, a year-on-year increase of 105%; service revenue reached $29 million, up 129%; deliveries exceeded 7,600 units, a 136% year-on-year growth.

Unfortunately, Lotus Technology’s daily trading volume is relatively low, making it difficult for large funds to invest. DJT, on the other hand, is entirely different, with daily trading volume reaching hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, making it one of the hottest companies in the market.

Cost of Capital (Real-World) - Equity vs Debt,1h032ix,HL_1972,2024-11-26 09:36:42,1,0.6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h032ix/cost_of_capital_realworld_equity_vs_debt/,"So this isn't about CAPM - I think enough has been written describing its limitations -but, rather, how a  company's stock price should guide corporate financing decisions in the real world. I think my question is best elucidated through an example.

Take, for example, the world's simplest (and public) company (and it exists in a tax-free universe!). It has 10M shares outstanding. The company only business is that it entered into a 5-year contract where, upon inception, it needs to invest $50M.  It will then receive a stream of cash flows (totaling $200M) and then pay a dividend to shareholders and liquidate. 

Now, a lender will offer to finance $60M ($50M + $10M for cushion) at a 10% fixed rate (100% due at maturity).

However, as the CEO you can obviously also sell stock. Now if the market get's overly exuberant (i.e. Gamestop in 2021) and assigns you a market cap of $1B, or $100 per share, then it is obvious that it is better (for existing shareholders) for you to issue 600k shares (or 6% of your current share count) to raise the $60M dollar.  On the other hand, if the market cap is severely depressed, say $25M (or $2.50 per share), then it doesn't make sense to issue 24M shares when you can get debt financing at 10%.

My question is, how do you analytically figure out what the ""break-even"" stock price is given some known cost of debt? (And, yes, we are also ignoring that debt should be cheaper because it has claims above equity). In a simple model I linked below, I tried to first do the equity financing scenario and then plugged in the cost of equity (which I calculated as the CAGR to the ending stock price) as the cost of debt but it resulted in different ending stock prices. What is the right way to solve for this ""break-even"" point.  See my simple model in the picture below.

Most of them were going downhill until then, but then they collectively went up really fast, even though at the same time we saw the largest plunge in the stock market in two years. Why is that?  
  
Some examples from August until today:

United: 34,61 to 92,40€ (+166%)  
Delta: 32,45 to 62,44€ (+92%)

RyanAir 13,60 to 18,59€ (+36%)  
EasyJet  4,80 to 6,40 (+33%)

And why are there some major airlines that aren't doing well at all, like Lufthansa, KLM (Air France) and of course Spirit? Fuel Prices should help all of them equally.  
I also read, that it's because of Trump's re-election, because he wants to loosen regulations. But that wasn't in August, so that doesn't make much sense either.

Buy a house or keep the money in stocks? (and keep spending crazy amount on rent),1gzw1lg,LawfulnessNo2927,2024-11-26 04:02:44,0,0.42,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gzw1lg/buy_a_house_or_keep_the_money_in_stocks_and_keep/,"

Anyone up for some brainstorming? I need advice.

I live in LA because my job wants me to be in the office twice per week. If they didn’t, I’d be living 80% of the year in Europe and the rest somewhere tropical. 

I just hit 500k in investments. I’m 36. 
They need to be diversified, so I will have to make some changes either way. 

I pay 3400 per month in rent. 
My take home salary is 6500 per month. 

Found a nice house in the mountains for 400k. It’s 1,5 hours from LA if I time it right. I can see myself wanting to keep it as a vacation home/rental income but for the foreseeable future I would live there and commute. The total monthly expense would be 2500 max, if I put 20% down. 

I’ve been successful before with designing my home and selling it with a very good profit. So I believe I have what it takes to make it a popular short term rental and also make a good profit when I want to sell. 

I think selling the place if I had to would be hard though, in the next few years which scares me. I could probably cover some of the cost by renting out, but that is also not guaranteed. 

I also would miss out on growth of the money I would put in the down payment. And it’s impossible to know if the house will be a good investment or not. But I would probably be ok keeping it, if nothing too crazy happens. So I would not sell at a loss. 

Any of you made a decision in a similar situation? Withdrawing from the stock market right now is not tempting, but neither paying half my salary in rent. ",2024-11-26,0.9869,Positive,"['LA', 'LA']"

As such, that makes it a very different vehicle than an IRA, 401k, traditional brokerage acct, etc., because unlike those options (that technically can be used for much more than just medical moreso than an HSA tends to) they are primarily for retirement **AND NOT** just for medical expenses.

That is a significant note to take note of  because say you're FIRE, want to use a portion for a house, want to roll money in from a former employer etc. You are **locked into** primarily **just** medical expenses which is the most unpredictable thing out there. Especially if younger. The real reason I'm asking is that unlike retirement, HSA's may have more immediate use cases. Especially with a family. As such, putting your funds into longer term investments sounds like a huge no go. However, plenty of people have said they still put the money in the longer term investments.

Now, you have the option of course just paying out of pocket in order to not touch the HSA, but if you do so you basically lock in not being able to touch your money without penalty until you're 65+(?) I believe. So while sure great ""triple tax advantage,"" but good luck touching that for that to matter until 65+. My initial thoughts have always been to keep it in short term investments like SGOV, USFR, etc. so I have it on hand for medical expenses and can even pay with a cc and reimburse myself from the HSA. 

I have, however, in the back of my head, thought ""I could instead use this for extra tax advantaged ""retirement savings,"" but since I'm an early retirement guy it flusters me to have to wait until 65+ to use money. I try to keep my options more fluid for access. What is your thinking on this for yourself? Do you keep it in short term investments? Do you go long term? A mix? Of course, folks who are sick constantly (God bless you and I wish you speedy recoveries) will probably adjust accordingly, but I'm curious of the general population's mindset on HSA investment?

The strategy I have in mind is to put small amounts of money in Bitcoin weekly or monthly (100-200$) and let it compound over time (10-20 years). Basically I’m looking at Bitcoin as a way to store money to not lose its value, and hopefully grow in the future.

Also I play on doing this on Binance due to the low fees and P2P options to buy crypto.

The question is: Is this a good strategy? would I risk my money by putting it in one platform or should I even buy a hardware wallet. If not, what are other ways to use Bitcoin as a mean to keep money value and let it compound over time, I heard about staking but I have no idea..

So I am looking to use Vanguard as my brokerage I was going to purely invest in S&P. I see there is VFIAX but you need to invest a minimum of $3,000 (which is a mutual fund) there is also VOO where I can do $10 weekly or whatever I want, is there any real differencr between the two?

The biggest thing holding me back from starting is I need to do a rollover roth and I am a little confused on how to do this? Do i just invest and do a traditional ira and somewhere there is a option for that? If you say do $7,000 into a traditional IRA and you make profits and rollover say its at $10,000 now does the whole $10,000 go in or that would disqualify you due to the fact its last the roth ira limit.

Why are SP500 and DJIA *open price* quotes completely out of whack (compared to actual opens & futures),1gz5uez,ash-t-1,2024-11-25 05:49:29,7,0.67,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gz5uez/why_are_sp500_and_djia_open_price_quotes/,"Basically, what the question says.

I compared the open/close % for future but many times that return is way different than the index return. Also, for DJIA, I calc'd the actual index (as it is just a simple average, divided by a divisor) - same issue.

Been scratching my head to understand this - if anyone knows, please enlighten me. Recent dates such as Oct 15 and Nov 6 are especially off for DJIA. Is there a reason for this?

Edit 1: obv, I'm looking at synchronous times of 9:30 am ET and 4 pm ET close.

Edit 2:

let's look at Oct 15 2024 for DJIA index. Using DJIA because it's easier to replicate using 30 stocks with simple avg.  
The open was ""43,240.17"" and close was 42,740.42 (per Google finance and also Yahoo finance). so the return is -1.16%

1. Futures check: If you look at the YM futures contract, the contract at 9:30 am was 43203 and close at 4pm ET was 43006. so the return is -.45%.
2. 30 stock components check: I also averaged the component stocks for DJIA. the sum of the open of all stocks and the sum of all the close of stocks ties out well. (ignoring the divisor, which doesn't matter for 1 day return) open: 6358.09 close: 6328.52 with -.45%.

I can provide the open and close for the components for that day if needed.

Is portfolio rebalancing worth it if you have to incur capital gains tax to do so?  ,1gz4agb,speshojk,2024-11-25 04:36:33,10,0.71,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gz4agb/is_portfolio_rebalancing_worth_it_if_you_have_to/,"Over the past four years, I've accumulated a pretty outsized position in my employer's stock due to being granted RSUs, participating in my company's employee stock purchase program, and then the stock price appreciating much faster than I had expected. I didn't intend for it to get this out of hand, but the current  breakdown is:   
   
Majority of portfolio:  
68% Employer stock  ($167,000 unrealized gain, $304,000 total value)

Remainder of portfolio:  
32% VOO, VOOG, and various other small positions in individual companies. 

My question is: is it really worth incurring the 15% capital gains tax on a $167,000 gain just to rebalance the portfolio? I want to get the employer stock position down to the recommended 5-10% and reinvest into an S&P500 or Total US Market index fund, but I don't see a way to do that without paying through the nose in taxes.

I understand the importance of diversification, but does it actually make sense to pay close to $30,000 in taxes to accomplish this? For instance, let's say the company stock takes a 10% hit. Well, that would also be in the neighborhood of a $30,000 loss, but it's only a loss on paper. In other words, I wouldn't have to pay anything out of pocket to the IRS. On the other hand, actively rebalancing the portfolio would mean I'd owe taxes next year and would have to find a way to come up with that money out of pocket.

    VOO 70%,
    QQQ 10%,
    VCLT(Long term corp bonds) 10%,
    TLT(Long term treasury bonds) 10%

And I live off 20K USD per year in India. Which gets me around 1.25 Lakhs per month roughly after taxes.

I am 33 years old. Single. My parents are leaving me an apartment in India. I also don't drink Alcohol or smoke. So I can lead a really luxurious life in India on that money. I also get to live with my parents in their old age. Which makes me feel good because I am not abandoning them in their old age as their only kid. Till they die we will be sharing expenses. Even if we don't I can comfortably cover my own expenses and their expenses too. I cannot cover their health emergencies. But they have around around 400K USD(3 crores of savings) to cover their health emergencies.

I am healthy. But even then, you can get an open heart surgery done in India for like 6000$ or 7000$. I can get like 3 to 4 of those before I die anyways. So if I even set aside 20K USD for health emergencies(I will also be getting a health insurance in India anyways) I will be still left with 980K USD.

I ran a Monte Carlo Simulation using this tool(https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/monte-carlo-simulation#analysisResults)

1. Inflation I set it to 6.75% mean and 2.8% Variance(That's roughly India's inflation parameters for the last 10 years. It's not exactly a normal distribution. But it's close enough to be called a normal distribution.)
2. USD generally seems to be always gaining over INR. By around 0.25% mean and 1.5% variance in the last 10 years. But I left that out intentionally.
3. I choose historical returns from 2014 to 2023.
4. Capital gains tax 20%, dividend tax 30%. Which is roughly what I have to pay to US and India together after Dual taxation avoidance treaty(DTAA).
5. No income tax because I would have no income in either India or US.

And it looks like in 95% of the cases, I will not run out of money in the next 75 years. Even if I do run out of money, I also have around 250K in 401K. That I am not going to touch, till I am 60. And it is 100% invested in VOO(or similar mutual funds). So in the 5% of the case that I do run out of money and I happen to live more than 90 years, I can use my 401K money.

Crypto and Blockchain! Does it earn a place in your portfolio?,1gyzxjf,Swole_Bodry,2024-11-25 01:28:21,0,0.25,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gyzxjf/crypto_and_blockchain_does_it_earn_a_place_in/,"Blockchain technology has been a significant focus of media and public discourse. Some view it as a revolutionary advancement with transformative potential, while others associate it with speculation and opportunism. Regardless of these perspectives, blockchain technology is more than just a speculative tool for investors; it has a variety of applications that could reshape industries. To fully appreciate this technology, it’s crucial to understand how it works and the scope of its capabilities.

A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger that records transactions in a decentralized manner. Unlike traditional ledgers controlled by a single authority, a blockchain is distributed across a network of participants. This decentralization ensures transparency, as all users can view the ledger, and consensus mechanisms allow the network to agree on its true state without requiring a central authority.

One widely used method for concensus is called Proof of Work (PoW), where miners solve complex computational problems to validate transactions. This process ensures the security of the blockchain by requiring the agreement of more than 50% of miners to determine the legitimate version of the ledger. Miners are incentivized through rewards in cryptocurrency and transaction fees.

Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism designed to address the high energy consumption of Proof of Work (PoW). Instead of miners solving computational problems, PoS relies on validators who “stake” their cryptocurrency as collateral to secure the network and validate transactions. Similarly, stakers get rewarded in fees and in the newly issued crypto asset. 

Another critical feature of blockchains, particularly Ethereum, is smart contracts. These self executing contracts encode agreements directly into code, ensuring automatic execution when predefined conditions are met. Smart contracts enable applications like decentralized finance (DeFi) and provide benefits such as increased transparency, reduced reliance on intermediaries, and automation. Behind each transaction, a gas token is a prerequisite to compensate validators. Think of this as the lubricant allowing the blockchain to operate smoothly, otherwise people could spam transactions and contest the network. 

Potential Applications of Blockchain Technology

1.Financial Services:

Blockchain enables low-cost, fast, and secure cross-border payments, requiring only a recipient’s public address.
Smart contracts facilitate decentralized financial applications, allowing users to lend, borrow, and earn interest without banks.
DeFi can expand financial access for the unbanked and underbanked, offering opportunities that traditional banking systems may not.

2.Supply Chain Management:

Blockchain can track real-world objects using tokens, improving supply chain transparency. Tokens can record timestamps, receipts, and provenance, addressing traceability issues in global logistics.

3.Digital Assets and NFTs:
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique, indivisible tokens with diverse applications beyond digital art, such as supply chain tracking, media rights, and digital receipts.
4.Other Uses:
Blockchain technology supports secure voting systems, intellectual property management, and efficient healthcare recordkeeping.

Challenges and Misconceptions

1.Association with Scams:
While blockchain’s decentralized nature empowers innovation, it also enables malicious actors to create fraudulent tokens and applications. Users must exercise due diligence to ensure the legitimacy of the platforms they interact with.
	
2.Environmental Concerns:
PoW-based blockchains like Bitcoin are often criticized for their high energy consumption. However, miners frequently utilize renewable energy sources due to cost advantages. Studies suggest that over half of PoW mining operations incorporate green energy.

3.Misunderstanding NFTs:
NFTs are often mischaracterized as solely representing digital artwork. In reality, they serve broader purposes, including representing real-world assets, enabling supply chain tracking, and verifying ownership of digital and physical goods.

Pros and Limitations of Blockchain

Pros:
Transparency: Publicly accessible ledgers ensure trust and reduce corruption.
Decentralization: Eliminates reliance on central authorities, increasing security and resilience.
Ownership: Blockchains empower individuals to own and take control of their own data rather than hand it over to intermediaries.

Limitations:
Scalability: Many blockchains face limitations in processing a high volume of transactions quickly.

Energy Consumption: PoW mechanisms consume significant energy, raising sustainability concerns.

Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments worldwide continue to debate how to regulate blockchain and its applications.

Speculation: While the various applications of blockchain seem promising, blockchains aren’t being used in many practical ways currently, and it is debatable on whether or not blockchain technology is capable of complementing or replacing existing technologies in any meaningful way.

My thoughts:

In the spirit of “owning the market”, I hold a small Crypto allocation, mainly in Ethereum. Proof of stake crypto currencies actually return fees to “stakers”. This is not too dissimilar to equities, where equity holders have a claim to the cash flows of a business. Ethereum is also a prerequisite to interact with any of the protocols or applications or tokens built on its network, thus there is demand for Ether beyond pure speculation. 

Other crypto assets, like Bitcoin, do not produce or really do anything, making it a subpar asset to hold til perpetuity. Its value is entirely extrinsic. 

Still, a healthy dose of skepticism is required. It’s not entirely clear to me, and many others, that this technology will meaningfully be implemented. ",2024-11-25,0.9985,Positive,[]

How are you thinking about your portfolio given the outcome of the 2024 US Election?,1gyxypj,DC_cyber,2024-11-25 00:06:08,0,0.26,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gyxypj/how_are_you_thinking_about_your_portfolio_given/,"As the new Trump administration takes office in 2025, we will all grapple with a rapidly evolving economic landscape. The anticipated policies promise significant shifts reminiscent of Hungary's economic transformation.   Please let me know if you agree or disagree with any of the picks below...

# Understanding the Policy Shifts

**1. Economic Nationalism and Protectionism**

The administration's ""America First"" agenda is expected to:

* **Increase Tariffs on Imports**: Tariffs could rise by 10-25%, mainly targeting Chinese goods. This move aims to protect domestic industries but may lead to higher consumer prices.
* **Promote Onshoring**: Incentives for companies to relocate manufacturing to the U.S. could include tax breaks and subsidies.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Beneficiaries**: Domestic manufacturers like **Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT)** and **3M Company (NYSE: MMM)** could see increased demand due to reduced competition from imports.
* **Potential Losers**: Companies reliant on imported materials or global supply chains like **Apple** may face higher production costs and supply-chain disruptions.

**2. Deregulation and Tax Cuts**

Anticipated measures include:

* **Corporate Tax Reductions**: Lowering the rate from 21% to 15% could significantly boost net earnings.
* **Deregulation Efforts**: Especially in energy and finance, rolling back regulations like Dodd-Frank could reshape industry operations.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Financial Sector Gains**: Banks like **JPMorgan Chase** and **Goldman Sachs** might experience increased profitability due to relaxed lending regulations and lower taxes.
* **Energy Sector Surge**: Traditional oil and gas companies like **Exxon Mobil Corporation** and **Chevron Corporation** could benefit from reduced environmental regulations and expanded drilling rights.

**3. Increased Government Intervention**

Potential actions:

* **Sector-Specific Policies**: Favoring industries aligned with national priorities, possibly leading to subsidies for sectors like defense and infrastructure.
* **Unpredictable Regulatory Changes**: Sudden policy shifts could affect long-term planning and investment.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Defense Contractors Advantage**: Companies like **Lockheed Martin** and **Northrop Grumman** may secure lucrative government contracts amid increased defense spending.
* **Risk of Cronyism**: Firms with close ties to the administration could outperform, while others may struggle to compete.

# What Lessons Can We Learn from Hungary Under Viktor Orbán

* **Nationalization and Heavy Taxation**: Foreign companies faced significant taxes, reducing foreign investment.
* **Favoritism Towards Domestic Firms**: Companies aligned with government objectives received advantages, distorting competition.
* **Market Volatility**: Unpredictable policies led to investor uncertainty and capital flight.

**Application to the U.S. Context:**

* **Regulatory Risk**: Investors should be wary of sudden policy changes that could impact sectors like technology and healthcare.
* **Importance of Government Relations**: Companies investing in government lobbying and aligning with national priorities may fare better.

# Sector-Specific Investment Opportunities and Risks

**1. Sectors Poised for Growth**

* **Energy Sector**
   * *Analysis*: With deregulation and a focus on energy independence, traditional energy companies will likely expand operations.
   * *Investment Picks*: Consider **Halliburton** for oilfield services and **Phillips 66** for refining and midstream operations.
   * *Commodities Impact*: Expect a potential rise in crude oil prices due to increased domestic demand, making investments in oil futures or ETFs like the **United States Oil Fund LP (NYSEARCA: USO)** attractive.
* **Financial Services**
   * *Analysis*: Deregulation could lead to increased lending and investment banking activities.
   * *Investment Picks*: Regional banks like **(NYSE: PNC)** may benefit from economic growth and deregulation.
* **Defense and Infrastructure**
   * *Analysis*: Increased government spending in defense and infrastructure projects.
   * *Investment Picks*: Infrastructure companies like **(NYSE: VMC)** and **Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM)** could see increased demand for construction materials.

**2. Sectors Facing Headwinds**

* **Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals**
   * *Analysis*: Potential reforms aiming to reduce drug prices could squeeze profit margins.
   * *Investment Risks*: Companies like **Pfizer** and **Merck** may face pricing pressures.
   * *Considerations*: Biotech firms focusing on innovative treatments may be less impacted.
* **Renewable Energy**
   * *Analysis*: A shift away from climate initiatives could reduce subsidies and support for renewable energy projects.
   * *Investment Risks*: Companies like **First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR)** and **NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE)** might experience slowed growth.
   * *Commodities Impact*: Potential decrease in demand for renewable energy commodities like lithium and rare earth elements.
* **Technology and Multinationals**
   * *Analysis*: Tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt global supply chains.
   * *Investment Risks*: Tech giants like **Microsoft** and **Alphabet** might face international market challenges.

# Navigating Market Volatility

**Strategies to Mitigate Risks:**

* **Defensive Stocks**: Consider utilities and consumer staples companies like **The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG)** and **Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE: DUK)**, which tend to be more stable during market fluctuations.
* **Gold and Precious Metals**: Historically seen as a haven, investing in gold through **SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA: GLD)** or mining companies like **Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: GOLD)** can hedge against volatility.

# Exploring International Investment Opportunities

**Emerging Markets Resilience:**

* **India**
   * *Analysis*: With a domestic solid growth trajectory, India is less exposed to U.S. policy changes.
   * *Investment Picks*: **HDFC Bank Limited (NYSE: HDB)** offers exposure to India's growing middle class.
* **Taiwan and South Korea**
   * *Analysis*: Key semiconductor and AI supply chain players are potentially insulated from U.S.-China trade tensions.
   * *Investment Picks*: **Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd**.

**Other Potential Diversification Plays:**

* **International ETFs**: Investing in funds like **iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA: EEM)** provides broad exposure to emerging markets.
* **Commodities**: Diversifying with commodities like copper and nickel, essential for global infrastructure and technology, can capitalize on international demand.",2024-11-25,0.9994,Positive,"['NYSE', 'CAT', 'NYSE', 'MMM', 'LP', 'USO', 'NYSE', 'PNC', 'NYSE', 'VMC', 'NYSE', 'MLM', 'FSLR', 'NYSE', 'NEE', 'NYSE', 'PG', 'NYSE', 'DUK', 'SPDR', 'GLD', 'NYSE', 'GOLD', 'HDFC', 'NYSE', 'HDB', 'AI', 'MSCI', 'ETF', 'EEM']"

529 vs taxable brokerage for post secondary in Canada,1gyw9bw,rjvCdn,2024-11-24 22:54:13,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gyw9bw/529_vs_taxable_brokerage_for_post_secondary_in/,"Not sure whether to start a 529 or a taxable brokerage for my daughters education.  I have a pretty unusual situation which makes it less straight forward

We are Canadian now living in the US
My son was born in canada and he has an RESP (Canadian 529) that I started when he was born and been adding to it every month.
My daughter is born in the US, but because of naturalization she is dual as well.  I haven't started an education fund yet because of some issues that had come up the last few yeass.  I will be coming into a fair bit of money in 4 to 6 months and can start an account with a large enough set to catch up to her brother and get us back on track as if I started when she was born 

Here's the tricky part. 
If my kids want to do post secondary, they're going to do it in Canada. Not worth going to school in America unless its on some kind of full scholarship.
For reference, my son has interest in Engineering like me, and a 4 year degree at my school (among top 5 in canada) costs less than 1 year at the same program at the big schools in my state. 45K CAD for 4 years is better than 124K USDfor the same program where we live

529s can be used for school in canada but my understanding is I wouldn't get the tax free benefits of a 529 because it's being spent in canada.  So because of that, is there an advantage to opening it anyways vs a taxable brokerage account.  The brokerage account would give more flexibility as how it's used and could potentially grow my more than a 529. 529s are good for school costs but some things related to being away from school aren't included (rent, food, transport, etc) so the brokerage could be working towards covering their basic living needs too

I'm actually working on Penmans 'Financial Statement Analysis and Valuation' and I have a question about the AEG-Model.

When i do my valuation based on the AEG - Model,  anchoring on forward P/E the formula is pretty similar to the residual income or DCF Model. 
In his examples he is dividing his calculatef  intrinsic value by the capitalization rate ( the same as the required rate of return?) to get the capitalized NPV. I have a hard time understanding this,  because the difference between an intrinsic value of say 2.48 is completely different than the value after capitalize it with like 10÷ (24.8) logically. 

From my feeling the 2.48 is the value that I use to challenge the market price, but why capitalize it then? Is it because the AEG model either ommiting Continuing Value or assumes a constant growth-rate?

I hope somebody may be able to help.

1. buying a property at that time
2. Invest in S & P 500 and wait for 20 years. 


Here are some calculations i came up with. 

1. Bought a house, if you bought a house for 73k 2004 your house price in 2024 would have been 350k~. Say your insurance is 1800$ yearly. What would be 36k after 20 years. Propert tax would be around 1% still comes to be 36k. 350k - 70k =280 K 

2. 73k worth S&P 500 would yield around 530k. If you sell 530k worth of stock and payed 15% tax = 450k. But you are still paying rent. I an average rent of say 1200$ per month. 
So you paid  1200$ x 12 months x 20 years = 288000$. That leaves you with 
450000 - 288000 =1,62,000. That’s just double of what you invested. 


In this case buying a house seems like a better idea.

Well here we are over a year later and things have only gotten worse. I don't know anyone who is satisfied with the search results, and many like myself have avoided using Google as much as possible.

I know they are a massive company with tons going on, but at the end of the day when you ask someone on the street what Google is they will tell you search. And the main part of their brand is about as bad as it can be currently.

Do you still feel confident investing in a company that cares this little about their main customer facing product? I mean, you could pretty easily argue they are intentionally trying to be bad. Yet the investment dollars keep piling in.

All I know is, if I was running a company like this I would do everything I could to fix the serps, having tens of millions of disappointed users every day doesn't seem like a good long term play.",2024-11-24,0.9207,Positive,[]
Emotionally invested in a stock and not selling despite all advice - what would you do?,1gyh9xz,coconutcremekitty,2024-11-24 08:35:52,3,0.59,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gyh9xz/emotionally_invested_in_a_stock_and_not_selling/,"Here’s the story: I started investing when I was much younger, self-employed, and didn’t have much money. The idea of investing seemed complicated and out of my reach but I heard about this company called ShareBuilder where you could buy fractional shares just purchasing stocks at $25 at a time. That’s how I made my first investment in an individual stock, with regular small to medium purchases for several years. 

Although I started investing in other stocks that first one kept growing until it was out sizing my portfolio. Everything I was reading, and everyone I spoke with - to this day - warns against having an out sized investment in one individual company. After being worn down by family and every book or article I read, about ten years ago I sold a chunk. After which the original stock continued to climb until as of today it’s grown 16,713%. My strategy over the years was to buy around it and try to build more diversity which I’ve been doing pretty good at. But it keeps doing well. 

I was going through my allocations and loaded everything in Empower’s app and once again I saw an alert that I had a lot in one security and should diversify. I had a really emotional NO reaction to seeing that. If I compare the funds I reinvested when I sold off a bunch, the gains are nowhere comparable. 

Realizing my reaction was a little over the top, I thought I’d see if strangers in the internet could give me some clarity 🤣

So my question is: has anyone been in a situation like this? What did you do? Did you listen to all the advice or continue to go with your gut? My gut says through its ups and downs, I think this is still a strong investment. If I was your friend or family member what would you say?

I’m not mentioning the company because there are a lot of opinions buy/sell about the company itself but through its ups and downs it’s been a good one for the long haul. And that was my intention, to buy for the long game. It’s been almost a 20 year long game now! Not trying to hide anything and happy to share the company name if someone’s interested.

I have been enjoying the sweet return on Money Market funds that I have had in these funds the past year or so.  

Recently, with markets at extremely elevated valuations, I find myself considering the possibility of another financial crisis or severe market correction that may present itself soon.  No one knows but it’s time for me personally to prepare for the possibility of a recessionary crash.  But let’s not get side tracked on that notion.

I’m reflecting on the GFC and I am wondering if money markets are really where I want to put some money.  Maybe I should consider long term treasury etf.  This would be money set aside specifically to buy stocks at discount in a market crash.

If there was a deflationary crash, long term bond prices should increase as people flock to safety.   I’m just not sure money markets are as safe as treasury etf.

Should I convert my rollover IRA to a ROTH IRA?

1. If i did convert it, Should i convert the whole amount all at once? Or do some every year over a period of like 4 years. All the reading it says I should wait for a low income years.

2. Has anyone regret doing it because of the high tax you have to pay?

3. I always did a backdoor ROTH, but now if i keep this large amount in an IRA, ill pay double tax because the pro-rata rule. Is it still worth doing a backdoor Roth and just paying the tax again?

I'm trying to learn the ropes on investing, and am working on my strategy. My plan is to put ~75% into an index (probably S&P 500) and leave the remaining 25% for more volatile, riskier trades. I'm young and all of the (limited) money I'll be investing is strictly left-over, so I'm very comfortable with any losses.

My first question is, does this sound like a sensible split?

And secondly, I plan to invest my left-over money monthly. I believe this is called dollar cost averaging, or at least will be an adaptation of it. So how do I decide how to split it across my instruments, considering that the initial 75/25 split won't remain constant once I make gains or losses. And, for my more volatile stocks, is it worth holding off and putting money in at times when they're lower?

I have some questions about mining companies that I haven't been able to find any decent answers to online though, and I was hoping you all would have some resources to point me towards or best practices. 

1. I'm currently invested in $TMQ.  It's performing very well right now, though I have no idea why.  I am chalking it up to sentiment, U.S. located mine, and restricted copper supply.  $TMQ is an exploration company though.  Eventually, that company will need to actually mine the minerals, and my understanding is that the mining is done through a separate, new company.  Is there a standard practice to this?  Will there be a spin off, or will $TMQ create a wholly owned subsidiary and I will continue to hold just the one stock?  I assume this is an ""it depends"" situation, but is there a general case?  

  
2. Mining companies are unique in that even the best run mines have a shelf life (the amount of metals available in the land holdings).  How do mining companies dispense value to share holders over the life of the mine?  Are they generally high dividend stocks or is the impetus on me to sell at some magical valuation moment.  I doubt that the value of the stock is ownership in the underlying commodity, I just don't understand how the shareholder captures value, and what the timing of that capture is.

**SCHD - Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF**:

* **Dividend Yield (FWD)**: 3.37%
* **Sectors**: Financials (20.03%), Health Care (14.57%), Consumer Defensive (13.27%), Energy (13.06%), Industrials (11.57%), Consumer Cyclical (10.82%), Technology (10.51%), Communication (4.56%), Basic Material (1.57%), Utilities (0.03%)

The 27% overlap ensures consistent exposure to strong dividend-paying stocks while leveraging the unique sector strengths of each ETF. This combination can provide a balanced portfolio with stability from utilities and financials (DVY) and diversified growth from SCHD’s broader sector spread.

Dollar Tree seems to have a more acute challenge with a down market customer and not a lot of room to push through pricing.

I honestly know little about investing, but realizing I really need to learn for myself and family.  

Currently I am looking to re-invest some money for my mom.  An annuity of hers recently matured and she was recommended by her advisor to put it back into another annuity to avoid taxes/fees for now.  From what I understand, you can do a 1035 into a new annuity and all the money gets transferred, no taxes or fees get subtracted.  

Is this a good idea or should she be looking at something other than another annuity (even if she has to pay taxes to get the money out)? She made a decent return on this last one and doesn't need immediate access to this money (about $300k) - she is really just looking for a place to put it so it grows and doesn't just sit there.  

Her house is paid for and she has few monthly expenses and checking/savings accounts that should have more than enough to support her.  

Right now her advisor recommended a New York Life Premier VA  and a Brighthouse Shield Level II VA.  I am not hearing a lot of positives on VAs so was just wondering good alternatives for someone with money already in a matured VA and is just looking for a conservative way to grow that money for a few years.

To my understanding, it’s a variable permanent life insurance policy, and I now have full control of it. The current beneficiaries are my father and my sister.

I’ve been seeking advice on what to do with this policy. One suggestion I received was to transfer it via a 1035 exchange into a variable annuity. However, I’m hesitant about this option because I dislike the idea of having limited access to my funds until retirement and having them managed by an external company.

At this stage in my life, my investments are structured primarily for growth. I’m 23, with no dependents or immediate plans for large purchases in the next few years. That said, I’d like to position myself to use some of my portfolio’s gains toward a down payment on a home in the future.

Currently, I’m considering cashing out the policy, paying the associated capital gains tax, and reallocating the funds into a taxable brokerage account, where I can invest in a mix of ETFs or index funds to maintain flexibility and control.

Here’s a summary of how I’ve structured my investments:
• Roth IRA (maxed yearly, with VOO and QQQ holdings)
• VTSAX 
• 401(k)
• High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA)
• Some cryptocurrency
• Individual blue-chip stocks


Given that I already actively manage my investments and have a clear plan, I’m leaning toward cashing out rather than transferring to a variable annuity. However, I’d appreciate any insights or alternative perspectives you might have. It’s possible there are aspects of this decision that I haven’t fully considered since I am still learning as I grow.

Gold miners GDX PE 31, 

consumer staples XLP PE 31, yeild 2.6

BRK which has a PE of 9.6 (but what does that really mean with BRK anyway)

money market which is getting about 4.5% right now with fidelity.  

  
I was thinking 50% in brk, then 25% money markets, then split the rest 

  
i worried about the consumer staples and gold miners funds though, because if i believe the PEs will fall, these fund is aready around 30, so may not be great.

Full details...

26 year old guy, single, no kids, renter, no debt, good net worth/financial cushion. Current asset allocation is \~70/30 stocks/bonds.

So...I'm planning to begin replacing bonds, then eventually stocks, with real estate. Obviously...the math has the math out for it to be worth it, because of the low liquidity of real estate. The hard metric that I use to make decisions is inflation-adjusted cash-on-cash return (appreciation is a nice bonus of real estate). 

Adjusted for inflation, I think \~6% is a reasonable annual ROI to expect from the stock market...so my philosophy is that my first year COC return should be \~6%+ (since real estate appreciation should ""offset"" inflation"") for it to be worth replacing stocks with real estate (or possibly a bit higher, due to capital gains taxes from selling index funds).

I hope this is the right sub for this...

I (31 year old, male) am looking to set myself up for success and retirement, and have been reading lots of blogs and books about future planning. One of the main things I hear (and read) is that ""the first 100k is the hardest part"" and that from there momentum and time will begin working in your favor at an exponential rate. But, I am not sure what that means...

Does that mean the first $100k in your retirement savings aka 401k/ 403b? Does that mean first $100k in stocks outside of a 401k/ 403b? Or does that mean a $100k value in some other manner like stock holdings outside of non tax advantaged vehicles?

I have worked both in the for profit and non profit industries so have both a 401k AND a 403b that combine to a value of $103,000. Just over $100k. Yay! Does that mean I have hit the elusive first benchmark of $100k? 

Moving forward, I will continue to push as much of my income as possible into my retirement but I am curious if there is something else I should be thinking about. Any clarity or insights is appreciated.

Specifically, he talks about how some of his best investing ideas initially came from a friend or family member raving about a particular product:

>*""Taco Bell, I was impressed with the burrito on a trip to California; La Quinta Motor Inns, somebody at the rival Holiday Inn told me about it; Volvo, my family and friends drive this car; Apple Computer, my kids had one at home and then the systems manager bought several for the office; Service Corporation International, a Fidelity electronics analyst (who had nothing to do with funeral homes, so this wasn’t his field) found on a trip to Texas; Dunkin’ Donuts, I loved the coffee; and recently the revamped Pier 1 Imports, recommended by my wife. In fact, Carolyn is one of my best sources. She’s the one who discovered L’eggs.”*

According to Lynch, this is the key advantage retail investors have over Wall Street: spotting great products and brands in their daily lives, often long before they arrive on an Investment analyst's desk.

I'm wondering whether this process can be modernised, and expanded.

One challenge I face, for instance, is that I don’t live in the U.S., so the American products I notice are often already global, and likely already on Wall Street’s radar. This limits my ability to discover the kind of early opportunities Lynch described if I want to invest in American companies. 

Same goes for brands in Asia or Africa—surely there are great companies out there, future ten-baggers, but many of us won't come across simply because we're not exposed to their products, and by the time we are we've missed the boat.

I’m curious if people know of tools or methods to help identify these hidden gems. 

Perhaps something like an online product rating site or resource for finding universally loved brands that haven’t gone mainstream yet. I’ve thought about using tools like Amazon's “top rated” section, but reviews can be manipulated, and often it's just Chinese tat you can't invest in. I also checked out r/buyitforlife, but it’s not quite what I'm after.

Conservative strategy assuming volatile markets and chaotic policies and regulating? ,1gwr6hj,DryFire77,2024-11-22 03:12:34,0,0.5,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gwr6hj/conservative_strategy_assuming_volatile_markets/,"TL;DR: Given the current volatility and uncertainty explained in more detail below, and my conservative risk profile, I am looking at (1) 1-3 year bond laddering probably through ~~defined term~~ target maturity bond ETF's, (2) defined outcome equity ETF's, and (3) some conservative equity ETF's. What are your thoughts on this strategy given the risk profile, and AIO or overthinking it?  
(regarding my thoughts on volatility and uncertainty - let's assume what I say below. I think discussion of this aspect should be in a separate post/thread - it is really interesting and really complex, and probably controversial and emotional. )

I am a conservative investor looking for capital preservation, inflation protection, and some value investing for the longer term. I am retired. I am fortunate. I have done well through my 401K, some investing outside of that, and tactical money management (e.g. refinancing mortgages, leveraging equity, simple lifestyle).  
(although I've missed some opportunities like Roth IRAs, I have benefited from my benign neglect investing strategy all those working years - index investing weighted towards equities, value investing, invest and forget - don't look at it more than once a month.

Assume for this question the markets will be volatile  
\- They might go up initially early in 2025 (both stocks and bonds) because of continuation of current economic activity and policies (lower inflation, stable employment, Fed rate small cuts, stable GDP increases, rising profits, Trump bump).  
\- But will go down (both stocks and bonds) because of chaos in government and changes in guiding principles and policies, rising inflation because of tariffs and bad policies and chaos, and eventually a downturn or worse.  
\- However, maybe the Street and bond vigilantes will force some better policies and more stability.

As a conservative investor in retirement, I am thinking of some combination of the following strategy (while not getting totally out of the market index ETFs):

1. Bond laddering (likely with ~~defined term~~ target maturity ETF's, high quality or even just treasuries) for 1, 2, and 3 year terms. This gives me some stability in yield if rates go down (e.g. 3 year terms), and some yield increase opportunities if interest rates go up (e.g. 1 year terms, or at the end of the 3 year terms). This likely keeps me above the inflation rate overall, and capital preservation with high quality, and income, no matter what the markets do. (I indicate ETF's because then I don't have to manage it and I have lots of options for terms, but with treasuries I might do that with actual bonds because they are relatively low effort to roll over, maybe even automatically?)
2. Stock buffer ETF's (defined outcome ETF's). This gives me equity upside although capped, and downside protection at least for the most likely downside (although I've even heard unlimited downside protection is out there too; haven't investigated yet). This provides capital preservation and rising market opportunities, no matter what the markets are doing. edit: I forgot a key aspect. These are typically term bounded to one or two years, and reset at the end of the term with new conditions. 
3. Conservative stock ETF's - utilities, dividends (quality), consumer staples, and broad market indexes although at a lower allocation than 2. This enables larger market opportunities, and risks less on the downside near term. In my world, these will be the 'alternatives' in my portfolio",2024-11-22,-0.8228,Negative,"['TL', 'DR', 'ETF', 'ETF', 'ETF', 'AIO', 'GDP', 'ETF', 'ETF', 'ETF', 'ETF', 'ETF']"

SEC Chair Gary Gensler to Depart Agency on January 20,1gwlxsq,golden-china,2024-11-21 23:39:28,155,0.93,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gwlxsq/sec_chair_gary_gensler_to_depart_agency_on/,"Washington D.C., Nov. 21, 2024 —

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that its 33rd Chair, Gary Gensler, will step down from the Commission effective at 12:00 pm on January 20, 2025. Chair Gensler began his tenure on April 17, 2021, in the immediate aftermath of the GameStop market events. He led the agency through a robust rulemaking agenda to enhance efficiency, resiliency, and integrity in the U.S. capital markets. He also oversaw high-impact enforcement cases to hold wrongdoers accountable and return billions to harmed investors.

“The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” said Chair Gensler. “The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world.

“I thank President Biden for entrusting me with this incredible responsibility. The SEC has met our mission and enforced the law without fear or favor. I’ve greatly enjoyed working with my fellow Commissioners, Allison Herren Lee, Elad Roisman, Hester Peirce, Caroline Crenshaw, Mark Uyeda, and Jaime Lizárraga. I also thank Congress, my colleagues across the U.S. government, and fellow regulators around the world.”

**Treasury Markets**

During Chair Gensler’s tenure, the SEC adopted critical enhancements to the $28 trillion U.S. Treasury markets. To lower cost and risk in the Treasury markets, the agency adopted rules to promote central clearing and narrow circumstances in which broker-dealers are exempt from national securities association registration. These reforms will lower risk and enhance efficiency throughout the entirety of the U.S. capital markets.

**Equity Markets**

Under Chair Gensler, the SEC made the first significant updates to the $55 trillion U.S. equity market in nearly 20 years. The agency unanimously made updates to the National Market System so that stocks can be traded more efficiently with narrower spreads and lower fees. Improvements also include shortening the settlement cycle to one day, which is good for investors and lowers risk in the market. Further, the agency unanimously adopted rules to update information regarding brokers’ execution quality. These reforms benefit investors by making equity markets more efficient.

**Resiliency**

The Commission adopted amendments during Chair Gensler’s tenure regarding Form PF, the confidential reporting form for certain SEC-registered investment advisers to private funds. The amended rules require that large hedge fund and private equity fund advisers make current reports on certain events to the Commission. The SEC further amended Form PF jointly with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to improve the quality of the information the agencies receive from all Form PF filers, and those changes will be implemented next year. Finally, the Commission adopted reforms to money market funds to make them more resilient, liquid, and transparent, including in times of stress.

**Corporate Governance**

To better promote trust in the capital markets, the SEC under Chair Gensler adopted a number of changes regarding corporate governance, including updating the rules for when corporate insiders can sell their shares, for when executives have to give back compensation based on erroneously reported financials, and for disclosure of executive pay versus performance. The agency also adopted new rules to allow shareholders to vote their preferred mix of board candidates on universal proxy cards in contested director elections. Additionally, the Commission adopted rules requiring more timely disclosure by those who are seeking control and buy more than a 5 percent stake in a company.

**Disclosure**

Since April 2021, the Commission has adopted several rules to ensure that investors get the disclosure they need from public companies and companies seeking to go public, broker-dealers, and investment advisors.

First, the Commission adopted rules to enhance disclosure around public company issuers’ cyber and climate risks, as well as for those companies seeking to go public via a special purpose acquisition company. The rules are grounded in materiality, as investors need this information to make buying, selling, holding, and voting decisions.

Second, the Commission adopted rules requiring certain broker-dealers and investment advisers to notify customers of data breaches that might put personal information at risk.

Finally, the Commission enhanced transparency to the markets by regularly publishing aggregate, anonymized data regarding registered investment funds, private funds, and investment advisers.

**Accounting and Auditing**

During Chair Gensler’s tenure, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), overseen by the SEC, successfully negotiated a Statement of Protocol with Chinese market authorities to allow the PCAOB to fully inspect and investigate, for the first time, the auditors of China-related companies listed in the United States. For the last two years, the PCAOB has been able to fulfill its inspection and enforcement-related responsibilities as it relates to audit firms in China and Hong Kong.

Further, in April 2021, the PCAOB had only updated five of the standards it adopted on an interim basis when it was created 20 years ago. The interim standards had been carried over from existing American Institute of Certified Public Accountants standards, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act envisioned that the PCAOB would update them soon after its creation. Since Chair Gensler was sworn in, the PCAOB has updated 18 interim standards and two other standards to reflect the current oversight needs in accounting and auditing.

**Examinations and Enforcement**

The Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations, which make up about half of the agency, have been steadfast cops on the beat during Chair Gensler’s tenure. The agency received more than 145,000 tips, complaints, and referrals and awarded approximately $1.5 billion to whistleblowers. The Commission filed more than 2,700 enforcement actions and obtained approximately $21 billion in penalties and disgorgement orders. Between fiscal years 2021 and 2024, the agency returned more than $2.7 billion to harmed investors as a result of enforcement actions.

Further, the SEC recovered more than $250 million for harmed investors through examination of investment advisors, investment companies, and broker dealers, among others. The Division of Examinations also enhanced communication with registrants by sharing more timely information about its annual priorities and observations and proactively engaging with industry and other regulators.

Under Chair Gensler, the Commission continued the work Chair Jay Clayton began to protect investors in the crypto markets. During Chair Gensler’s tenure, the agency brought actions against crypto intermediaries for fraud, wash trading, registration violations, and other misconduct.

In the last full fiscal year, according to the SEC’s Office of the Inspector General, 18 percent of the SEC’s tips, complaints, and referrals were crypto-related, despite the crypto markets comprising less than 1 percent of the U.S. capital markets. Court after court [agreed](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pli-s-56th-annual-institute-securities-regulation-111424#_ftn37) with the Commission’s actions to protect investors and rejected all arguments that the SEC cannot enforce the law when securities are being offered—whatever their form.

**About Chair Gensler**

He also was senior advisor to U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes in writing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) and was undersecretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance and assistant secretary of the Treasury from 1997-2001.

Earlier in his career, Chair Gensler worked at Goldman Sachs, where he became a partner in the Mergers & Acquisition department, headed the firm’s Media Group, led fixed income & currency trading in Asia, and was co-head of Finance, responsible for the firm's worldwide Controllers and Treasury efforts.

A native of Baltimore, Md., Chair Gensler earned his undergraduate degree in economics in 1978 and his MBA from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, in 1979. He has three daughters.

Recency bias or has something fundamentally changed?,1gwl9qd,anonimitazo,2024-11-21 23:13:51,17,0.65,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gwl9qd/recency_bias_or_has_something_fundamentally/,"So, ever since I started investing, back in 2019 I have read doom and gloom predictions of bear markets and stock market crashes and how valuations were too high. Now I know better that simple valuations does not predict stock price movements alone. But I believe that we live in strange times... It is humbling to see the 90 year history of the S&P500: [https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data](https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data)

The stock market has always been trending upwards and bear markets have had just a tiny effect, but inflation adjusted paints a whole another picture. In the worst case scenario, 20 years could pass and you  lost all value to inflation (not including dividends). The amazing returns we have seen in the past 1.5 decades is more the exception than the norm. But it is also curious to see that we have not had any major recession since 2007-2008, that is 17 years this 2025!! (I would not count COVID here, since it was very short, and it is not something linked to the economy). You can see how the frequency of recessions have been going down over time... [https://collabfund.com/blog/its-been-a-while/](https://collabfund.com/blog/its-been-a-while/) . So there is clearly a difference in the economy.

But the economy is not all, there is also psychology. Nowadays more people invest than ever before because of low cost and increased accessibility. This means that new investors have a recency bias towards bull markets and good economic conditions. The stock market rallied after Trump election given his promises to lower corporate tax rates and lower regulations, but anyone who has an understanding of economics will realize that what he wants to achieve and what he promises to do is contradictory. Mass deportations and high tariffs are not good for the economy either. Are investors too focused on the short term to see the long term effects? I am not pro-Kamala Harris either, don't get me wrong.

Given that there have been no major recessions since 2007, I also think this could explain the massive success of growth over value. The world has clearly changed since Charlie Munger's time. Do you think this is something to last, or are we living an economic mirage? What retrospective explanations do we have to explain the apparent stability we have been living? And yet, not everybody feels like they are doing better economically. What could break this stability? Does higher stock prices mean lower returns in the decades to come? I am philosophizing at this point and I do not know the answer, but I would like to know what you think. ",2024-11-21,0.9729,Positive,['COVID']

Should I move my USD to EUR now that I live full time in France?,1gwc5b6,benbahdisdonc,2024-11-21 14:39:58,9,0.62,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gwc5b6/should_i_move_my_usd_to_eur_now_that_i_live_full/,"Hello all, I'm hoping this is the right place/way to ask this.

I have almost zero knowledge about stocks, investments, etc. 5 years ago I moved to France from the US, and it is safe to say that I will not be moving back to the US. I'm working, married with a French woman, have a daughter. I have moved my entire life over here.

We are looking to buy a house here, and I am thinking that now is a good time to move my investments and USD to EUR. I was hoping for some advice. Also, general advice, as I see the USD is strong at the moment, buying 0.95€.

I have the following accounts:

* liquid/checking/savings: $1k, I've already been using this
* Invesco: $33k
* HSA: $7k
* 401k: $19k
* IRA: $3k

Moving Invesco incurs no fees, so that is a simpler question of just ""will it grow even more in the next few months?"". I'm leaning towards no, and to just go ahead and transfer that over, as an investment in a larger down payment for a house seems like a wiser choice.

The other accounts are all small retirement accounts. I know I would be hit with fees for withdrawing from them, but part of me wants to just go ahead and pull the money out and rip the bandaid off. what is more valuable, that $7k right now toward a house, or that money as and HSA in 32 years?

Or is that being too short-sighted? And it would actually be best to keep an investment vehicle in USD? Or save those retirement accounts for another 32 years (I'm currently 33)?

Any advice would be extremely appreciated.

I have another $100,000 of equity in my house that I can use for a down payment on my next house if I choose to move, but I also like having that additional $50,000 sidelined in case a deal comes up quickly or the market goes down. I’m investing everything above the $100k though and add $50,000 plus per year to that fund. I’ve tried single stocks but am too emotional and like the S&P to keep me from making any irrational moves.

I mention this because I've been helping aging family members convert chunks of their physical estates to cash to have in their twilight years, and tons of stuff they thought had value (because at one point it did) did quite poorly in the end. Luckily they weren't dependent on the funds from this, but was still a bummer after holding on to it for decades. There's a shrinking market for so much of this stuff as the older generations become net sellers and younger generations have no interest in it, not to mention tighter economic conditions, etc.

Out of curiosity, what collectables do you think will stand the test of time and never lose value, if not continue to increase?

The Microstrategy dual flywheel,1gvxxx3,notapersonaltrainer,2024-11-21 01:00:29,8,0.72,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gvxxx3/the_microstrategy_dual_flywheel/,"I’ve been digging into what’s driving MicroStrategy’s price appreciation, and wanted to share my understanding. This isn’t investment advice or a recommendation in any direction and just descriptive. 

There are two components to this flywheel. The stock price premium and convertible bonds.


---

**Stock Price Premium**

MicroStrategy leverages its stock price premium (200%+ above its Bitcoin holdings) to grow its Bitcoin per share efficiently:

- 
   Example: Raising $1 billion at a 216% premium results in just $316 million in dilution but adds $1 billion in Bitcoin. Each raise increases Bitcoin per share, further fueling the premium in a self-reinforcing cycle.

- 
   The strategy combines:
   1. Bitcoin price appreciation - assumed 25% annually.  
   2. Bitcoin Yield - efficiently raising capital at a premium, targeting 8% annual growth.  
   3. Leverage - low-interest debt adds further returns.  

-   This could potentially grow $15 billion into $87 billion over five years, but it hinges on sustaining the premium—if it collapses, the strategy breaks.

- 
   Owning 252,000 BTC (more than all public companies combined) positions MicroStrategy as a unique bridge between traditional finance and Bitcoin, with future potential in lending or derivatives.

---

**Convertible Bonds**

MicroStrategy’s convertible bonds attract investors by combining bond safety with Bitcoin upside:

- Investors lend money via bonds (e.g., 0.75% interest) with the option to convert to $MSTR shares. This gives exposure to Bitcoin’s growth without directly holding it.

- Investor Benefits:  
   - Downside Protection: Fixed interest payments and principal repayment safeguard against Bitcoin volatility.  
   - Upside Potential: If $MSTR stock rises with Bitcoin, bondholders can convert and profit.  
   - Premium Boost: Since $MSTR trades at a premium, conversion offers amplified returns compared to Bitcoin alone.

-  
   An investor buying $1,000 in bonds earns annual interest but can convert to shares if Bitcoin rallies, gaining equity upside with limited risk.

Timing on selling out of concentrated stock position (severance and tax bracket in mind),1gvvx9v,scurdatum,2024-11-20 23:38:32,4,0.7,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gvvx9v/timing_on_selling_out_of_concentrated_stock/,"My wife's position was recently eliminated at work due to a merger.  In the time she had worked there, she had earned a fair amount of company stock as compensation, leading to a higher-than-desired concentration of our investments in that stock.  We'd like to sell down that concentration, but I'm trying to figure out the best timing to do so.  Here are some factors to consider:

* My wife also received severance when her position was eliminated.  That lump sum pushed us just a bit into the next tax marginal tax bracket.
* Any unvested stock went away upon separation, so we're only talking about fully vested shares at this point.
* Shares are mostly held over one year, and therefore LTCG.  There is a chunk of them, though, that would still be short term.
* Since separation, the stock price has increased a bit, and overall, most of the shares were acquired at prices below the current stock price.  So not much tax loss harvesting to be had.  
* While my wife will return to work, she's going to take a bit of time off.  Ultimately, this likely means that our combined income from work next year will be much lower than this year (especially considering the severance lump sum).  

I was thinking I'd first see if there was any chance that selling those shares that would net us a loss might drop us down into our pre-severance tax bracket.  I haven't done that homework yet, though.  Otherwise, though, my plan was to sell most if not all of our LTCG shares as soon as we're in the new year, and then wait for the remaining shares to pass that year threshold before selling them as well.

MU: Earns a Spot on the Watchlist ,1gvvn7g,,2024-11-20 23:27:31,0,0.22,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gvvn7g/mu_earns_a_spot_on_the_watchlist/,"Micron is probably one of the best opportunities to pick up some shares. Long-term, this company is set to do very well. As one of the only large chip manufacturers with most of its manufacturing presence in the U.S., the company is poised for expansion.

While Intel is set to receive the largest amount from the CHIPS Act ($8.5 billion directly) and a further $11 billion in loans combined with additional tax credits, Micron is not far behind, with plans to receive $6.14 billion in direct funding.

This is meaningful because Micron is a smaller, newer company, and as a result, it has much more potential for growth compared to an already established giant like Intel.

In addition to the CHIPS Act, the United States currently has bipartisan support to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., which would be more effective than imposing costly tariffs on China without building up a domestic manufacturing presence.

Micron is currently a key supplier of high-bandwidth memory (HBM3E) for NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs. Although they are not solely supplying their chips to NVIDIA, having an initial edge in what will likely be the leading chip line (NVIDIA's Blackwell line) will be crucial.

Micron’s customization options for customers are also a significant advantage, though it’s not currently getting much attention.

Additionally, Micron's new chips provide major breakthroughs in energy savings:

* **HBM3E (High Bandwidth Memory 3E)**: This advanced memory technology offers over 1.2 TB/s bandwidth and is built on Micron's 1β process node. It delivers a 2.5x improvement in performance per watt compared to previous generations.
* **LPDDR5**: Targeted at mobile devices, Micron's LPDDR5 DRAM provides 50% faster data speeds and 20% more power efficiency than earlier LPDDR generations, resulting in 5-10% better battery life for applications like 8K video and virtual reality.
* **1β DRAM Process Node**: Micron's 1β (1-beta) DRAM technology enhances power efficiency by 15% and increases bit density by 35% over previous nodes.

Although Micron has faced challenges in the past, with its revenue recovering from its 2022 high of nearly $30 billion, this provides a good opportunity for a potential bounce back, which could ultimately drive its share price higher.

With AI expansion and the new U.S. policies, I anticipate domestic chip manufacturers will receive favorable treatment in terms of tax breaks and other incentives, further strengthening their position over foreign competitors.

While the share price has fallen from $150 down to $100 at the time of writing, I see a strong possibility of it bouncing back to previous levels, as long as they continue the work they are doing now.

And although people are questioning the high P/E ratios, I expect earnings growth to bring this ratio under control in future quarters. Besides, we have seen stocks with high P/E ratios perform exceptionally well based solely on their growth potential.

Bitcoin discussion (skeptical view),1gvkga1,Silent-Carry-4617,2024-11-20 13:20:22,15,0.55,305,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gvkga1/bitcoin_discussion_skeptical_view/,"Not sure if discussing bitcoin as an investment is allowed, but with the recent trend I wanted to take a step back and discuss this. 

The main reason people say to buy bitcoin as an investment is that
1.There is a limited supply
2. It functions like money

So the general theory is that once all the coins are mined, that's it. And people will keep buying more and more until the coins are mined. So the price will be incredibly high at the end.

However, some counter points is that 
1. Gold is similar, so why isn't gold blowing up like bitcoin.
2. There are other crypto coins that can be spun up easily. All it takes is for one of US government to just say oh well, bitcoin is now illegal, you can use our usa crypto coin tho.

Today we all agree that bitcoin is worth 90k. But structurally bitcoin is the same as the other cryptos and nfts, so... 

As a counter to myself, the mono lisa is just a painting, but we all agree it is priceless. But in the future, will this be the same for bitcoin? Is this what everyone is really investing in? Agreed value in the future?

Investors, in other words, do not think Mr Trump’s presidency will be predictable. They think its unpredictability is unpriceable.*

I'm wanting to build a globally diversifired credit risk / fixed income portfolio, essentially from scratch to compliment and add diversification to my equity portfolio. Im happy to take on more risk than treasuries and understand this may reduce the overall diversification benefit. My thinking is that this would become closer to 25% of my portfolio as I approach retirement, along with another 25% of treasuries.

The only prerequisite for segments & funds is that they are available to retail invested and listed on an exchange somewhere, as I'm outside the US, I'm unable to invest in most US mutual funds. Happy to consider both ETFs and CEFs or companies which will likely provide a dividend return

I've considered re-insurance, CLOs, emerging market sovereign & corporate debt, mREITs, CDOs and even CAT bonds (can't find for retail investors) and others and just wanted to know if there are other segments I've missed and how others would go about achieving this goal and the sorts of asset allocations you would conder using.

Is this something I can use to buy an ETF, like VOO? I thought I would have to sell to do that?

Now, even though i qualify as an accredited investor, I know zero of the PE space, so i did as much research as i could, but sometimes as an outsider you don't know the right questions to ask.   

So far what i can tell is they purchase blocks of spacex from hedges, place them in an spv and look for accredited investors.  The SPV is holding actual shares of spaceX.

25k minimum buy in.  5% up front management fee.  No maintenance fees, or other SPV fees.  There is a premium on the spaceX shares of $175/share  (effectively sold at a $328B valuation) as opposed to the $135 ($250B Valuation) tender offer that was just announced.  They take cut of profits via a 20% carrier interest.  A provision that if starlink is spun off, they'd give 1 starlink share for every 3 shares of the spacex spv you hold.   Finally an offer of money back (minus the 5% management fee) in 5 years if spacex doesn't so public.

If i'm doing my math right, if spaceX (and starlink combined) went public and 3x'ed from an aggregate value of $250B val to a $750B val, i'd roughly double my initial investment.

Is This the Correct Way to Handle Bank Fees and IRR in Portfolio Performance?,1gv72i8,Ambush995,2024-11-20 01:58:44,1,0.6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gv72i8/is_this_the_correct_way_to_handle_bank_fees_and/,"Hey everyone, I’ve been working on setting up **Portfolio Performance (PP)** for my investments, and I’m trying to make sure my handling of external **bank transfer fees** (fees I pay to transfer money to my brokerage account) is accurate, especially when calculating **IRR**. Here’s the situation:

* When I transfer **2015 EUR** from my bank account to fund my IBKR account:
   * **15 EUR is deducted as a bank fee** (external fee), so **2000 EUR actually lands in IBKR** for investment.
   * In PP, I’ve set this up using two accounts:
      1. A **Bank Account**: Logs the full deposit (2015 EUR), the fee (15 EUR), and the transfer of 2000 EUR to IBKR.
      2. An **IBKR Account**: Logs the 2000 EUR as the amount available for investing.
* To make the **15 EUR fee visible in the performance tab**, I record it on the **next day** (i.e., the day after the transfer). This shows:
   * **2015 EUR as the initial value of the portfolio**, since that’s the total amount I spent to fund the IBKR account.
   * The **15 EUR fee as a separate transaction**, ensuring it’s included in the IRR calculation.
   * The **2000 EUR transfer to IBKR is still correctly reflected**.
* **If I record the 15 EUR fee on the same day** as the deposit and transfer:
   * The **initial value is shown as 2000 EUR**, with no fee displayed in the performance tab.
   * I’m concerned that this means the fee isn’t being included in the IRR calculation, which could lead to inaccurate performance tracking.

**Questions I Have**:

1. Is it **correct to record 2015 EUR as the portfolio's initial value**, even though only 2000 EUR was deposited into IBKR for investing?
2. Is the **1-day delay for the fee problematic**? It ensures the fee is visible and included in IRR, but I wonder if repeated delays (e.g., every time I transfer money) could cause issues over the long term.
3. Would it be better to record the fee on the **same day** as the transfer, even if PP doesn’t display it in the performance tab and only shows an initial value of 2000 EUR?

Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I want to make sure I’m tracking my investments accurately and calculating IRR in the best possible way.

GigaCloud ($GCT): Buying When Nobody Wants It,1gv31pp,Maestroszq,2024-11-19 23:13:16,7,0.73,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gv31pp/gigacloud_gct_buying_when_nobody_wants_it/,"**TL;DR:** I believe [GigaCloud](https://www.gigacloudtech.com/)'s stock will experience a price rally driven by strong fundamentals and its current undervaluation. I'm bullish on its business model, economic potential, and attractive pricing. I’m not expecting a 5x or 10x rally, but I do think a 2x gain is reasonable with a solid margin of safety. A DCF analysis indicates a fair price of $40. From a technical perspective, the company has delivered solid earnings growth quarter after quarter and has had years to consolidate, forming a large cup pattern.

I’m holding 105 LEAPS for '26 and '27. This stock could potentially double, or it could drop to zero. Take it with a huge grain of salt. All information shared here is purely my opinion and should not be considered as advice. I’ve lost money, except for IonQ where I got lucky.

# Introduction

**Company:** GigaCloud Technology  
**Ticker:** $GTC  
**Industry:** Online Merchandise/E-Commerce Platforms  
**Price:** $22.96

Over the past few days, I’ve been diving deep into a small, sub-$1B market cap company, and after reviewing various opinions on $GTC online, I wanted to share my own thoughts.

The company has faced two short reports from [Grizzly](https://grizzlyreports.com/gigacloud-technology-inc-another-china-hustle-inflating-key-metrics-using-undisclosed-related-party-shell-companies/) and [Culper Research](https://x.com/CulperResearch/status/1707392689367347709), alleging that GigaCloud inflates its numbers using shell companies, reports costs as revenue, and falsifies addresses in official documents. While this is mostly boring stuff, it’s certainly had an impact, with the stock dropping by 50% since the reports were released. The company did [respond](https://investors.gigacloudtech.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gigacloud-technology-inc-responds-short-seller-report-0) to the allegations, and has requested to dismiss the class action filed by investors.

After conducting my own research, I have a different view. I see signs of a potential compounder in the making, and I believe the current valuation makes it a worthwhile bet. I won’t go into too much detail here, as that would be boring to read, but I’ll keep it brief. This isn’t meant to be a detailed thesis, just a quick summary of the key points behind my bullish outlook.

You can find all the relevant information in the company’s annual report, the CEO [interview](https://x.com/CulperResearch/status/1707392689367347709) on Seeking Alpha, and several third-party articles. I have more insights to share, but it would be too long to write it out in a single post.

There’s also some speculation about $GCT following a similar technical pattern to Amazon after its IPO, and I won’t dive into that here, as it’s a bit far-fetched. What’s more interesting to me is the comparison between Amazon’s [early days](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/28/a-look-back-at-amazons-1997-ipo/) in the fragmented book market and Giga’s furniture business. Both industries were large and fragmented when these companies started, with a chance to take a lot of market share, and that’s a key factor in my outlook on $GTC’s potential.

# Operations

The company operates a platform called [GigaB2B](https://www.gigab2b.com/), where it connects businesses with products manufactured in industrial countries like China, Vietnam, India, etc. While selling products itself isn't particularly flashy, the strength of GigaCloud's model lies in the value it provides beyond simple merchandising. This platform doesn't rely on the typical low margins associated with standard product sales.

GigaB2B connects large businesses: the sellers are manufacturers, and the buyers are companies looking to sell inventory to their own customers. What sets the platform apart is its ability to meet the needs of foreign businesses that lack affordable ways to directly reach their target customers, and U.S. buyers looking to trade these essential products. By consolidating this process into one channel, GigaCloud effectively simplifies international trade and logistics for businesses that might otherwise struggle to connect.

Many of the visits occur through API connections, as GigaCloud functions as a digital warehouse, payment system, and ERP platform, linking their customers' systems directly to their store. Additionally, they offer a [Shopify app](https://apps.shopify.com/giga) to provide further value.

I found this [article](https://www.furnituretoday.com/opinion/the-inventory-problem-how-e-commerce-thrives-where-brick-and-mortar-struggles-guest-contributor/) incredibly helpful to understand the business.

# Tariffs and Bad market

The company specializes in selling furniture, and while the housing market is currently in a challenging position, this sentiment is already reflected in the stock price. However, I believe that despite the bleak outlook for housing, consumers might still experience some relief as central banks globally look to implement quantitative easing by lowering interest rates. As sad as it may sound, even though home buyers may not be able to move, people may still have more disposable income to spend. With this extra cash, rather than moving to a new home, many could choose to invest in improving their current living space by purchasing more home goods.

Regarding tariffs, I'm not overly concerned. I believe the negative implications of tariffs are already priced into the stock, based on the assumption that tariffs will severely hurt companies and overshadow their profits. The new rules and tariffs primarily affect drop-shippers from China to the U.S., where there’s no middleman involved, just direct shipping of small items from platforms like Temu or Alibaba. However, since GigaCloud operates its own warehouses in the U.S. and Europe, it functions as both the buyer and seller, insulating itself from the negative effects of tariffs on drop-shipped goods.

We’ll have to wait for more stability to understand the concrete changes, but I think the negative effects of these factors have been significantly overblown, and that they will turn out to be much ado about nothing for this stock. Of course, I could be proven wrong. I'm not a tax expert, but the company's outlook remains bullish, as they continue to demonstrate confidence in their ability to grow and expand despite macroeconomic challenges, as highlighted in their recent earnings calls.

# Catalysts

The acquisition of [Noble House](https://noblehousefurniture.com/), a smaller U.S. furniture company, is expected to break even by the end of 2024, with financial benefits becoming apparent in the first two quarters of 2025. Noble House brings thousands of SKUs to the platform, contributing to the company’s growing sales and expanding its market share.

Given the current political climate, with an incoming administration focused on deregulation and the potential for increased market confidence through lower interest rates, M&A activity is anticipated to surge in the coming year. In a fragmented industry with significant market share still up for grabs, each incremental acquisition, like Noble House (if proven to be accretive), could boost revenue and increase the platform's overall value.

Moreover, with the company holding relatively substantial cash reserves, it is in a strong position to pursue further [acquisitions](https://www.furnituretoday.com/financial/acquistion-complete-gigacloud-finalizes-85-million-deal-for-furniture-maker-and-retailer/), which could accelerate its growth trajectory. This makes it well-positioned to capitalize on an environment ripe for consolidation.

# The Street's view

While many bear reports focus on claims that the company is outwardly 'fake', alleging that its numbers, employees, and balance sheet are fabricated, few of these critiques dive into the operational side. They rarely discuss why the business model could stagnate in the coming years or how increased competition might adversely affect GigaCloud.

On the other hand, bulls tend to align with the company's outlook, focusing on current data. They highlight the company's relatively 'cheap' valuation, as indicated by a low PE ratio and price-to-enterprise value, while also emphasizing the expected growth rate as the basis for their bullish thesis. This perspective often isolates GigaCloud within its current ecosystem of partners and the furniture market it serves.

However, I take a different approach. When analyzing GCT, I base my thesis on management’s past actions and their long-term vision. Similar to how Costco and Amazon started with small operations, building up one warehouse at a time and selling limited goods, GigaCloud may follow a similar path. These companies benefited from economies of scale as they grew, and I believe GigaCloud has the potential to do the same. By focusing on niche markets, particularly large and 'bulky' goods that many competitors avoid due to logistical complexities, the company is tapping into a profitable, under-exploited area. With growth, this core competency could enable GigaCloud to achieve scaled economies and strengthen its market position.

# Scaled economies

The potential for [scaled economies ](https://www.incrementaleconomics.com/scale-economies-shared/)is incredibly valuable, as it not only reduces costs and improves unit economics but also expands margins, making the company more attractive to investors. This, in turn, could lead to higher valuations, particularly through more bullish discounted cash flow models due to the retention of cash. However, what's even more significant is how these savings and accumulated cash could be passed along to customers, or ""users"", on the platform. This is a key factor behind Costco's success, where they leverage bulk products and membership fees to earn revenue, or Amazon's ability to offer competitive prices on its platform.

For GigaCloud, now focused on the furniture sector, the resulting lower unit economics could be passed on to partners, enhancing the platform's appeal. By offering better value to their customers, GigaCloud can potentially strengthen the overall ecosystem, by passing on the cost benefits.

As of the previous quarter’s presentation, the company has reached a significant milestone with 1,051 active sellers, manufacturers based in various countries, and 8,535 buyers, who purchase bulk goods at B2B prices and then mark them up for sale in markets like the U.S. and Europe.

# AI Story

Coming from Palantir at the start of this year, to IonQ, and now Giga, the tech seems to deteriorate in the fastest fashion. However, while Giga is not a ""tech"" company in the traditional sense, the views on AI and Giga, especially from Wall Street, strike me as pretty amusing.

Bears focus on the platform’s chat capabilities and argue that Giga lacks AI features. I don’t think chat is that important, and LLMs would be better used for back-end logistics. Giga might not have the most advanced models or software stack, but they use what they have well for their industry. The company handles a lot of goods and, through their software and existing logistics systems, calculates the most efficient way to send them from other countries.

Management talks about AI, but not in the same way S&P 500 CEOs do. The tech’s been around for over 30 years, and a lot of companies have been quietly using it in the back end for things like pricing and routes. I get the bear argument that Giga’s trying to piggyback on the AI trend, but I disagree. The company’s been using those systems behind the scenes long before the current AI hype became mainstream and was used by every CEO.

# Technicals

GigaCloud's current P/E ratio stands at 6.9, which is notably low for a company with growing revenue and an expanding user base, in my opinion.

The most important fact is that [Cramer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Au0PfFbc0) has raised concerns about the company and published a bearish video on it six months ago.

# Closing Remarks

As mentioned earlier, many influential voices are bearish on the stock, citing concerns such as tariffs, potential China-related scams, and weakening consumer demand. However, I tend to buy when sentiment is negative, as long as the short-term fundamentals remain solid. While there's always the possibility that things could go wrong, I've incorporated this risk into my overall risk/reward analysis.",2024-11-19,0.9995,Positive,"['TL', 'DR', 'DCF', 'LEAPS', 'GTC', 'GTC', 'CEO', 'GCT', 'IPO', 'GTC', 'API', 'ERP', 'PE', 'GCT', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'CEO']"

When I started 7 years ago I basically maxed my contribution and put it all in a Target 2050 fund. 

The fund targets people who retire in the year 2050. There is no employer matching. It's basically there as an option for retirement and I guess it helps you if you are close to the border of the tax bracket so you can lower it since you are deciding straight from your salary. 

As I have grown and learned a small amount more about investing, im starting to wonder if I should change it.

The fund has a combination of large cap, mid cap,small, and some other funds. The idea is that at first it takes more risk but as you get closer to the retirement, It because more conservative. It has an expense ratio of .19 percent and is somewhat actively managed.

Palantir $PLTR is extremely overpriced.,1gu77l5,Diamond1africa,2024-11-18 20:54:55,263,0.77,192,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gu77l5/palantir_pltr_is_extremely_overpriced/,"**1. Valuation Metrics Are Sky-High**  
Palantir currently trades at a Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of approximately 53.13, significantly higher than industry peers.

[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ps-ratio/PLTR) Even for a growth company, this level of valuation is extreme and implies future growth rates that may be unattainable.



**2. Revenue Growth Isn’t Scaling as Expected**  
While Palantir’s revenue growth has been solid, it’s showing signs of deceleration:

* FY 2022: 24% year-over-year growth
* FY 2023 (projected): 18% year-over-year growth

This deceleration doesn’t justify its premium valuation. Additionally, the company remains heavily reliant on government contracts, which are often lumpy and unpredictable.

**3. Profitability Is Still Questionable**  
Despite boasting about achieving GAAP profitability recently, Palantir has heavily relied on stock-based compensation (SBC). In fact, SBC accounted for approximately 30% of their operating expenses last quarter, which dilutes shareholder value and raises questions about true profitability.

**4. AI Hype Is Inflating the Bubble**  
The market has been overly optimistic about Palantir’s AI capabilities. While their AI Platform (AIP) sounds promising, actual adoption metrics and revenue contribution from AIP remain vague. It’s easy to talk AI; it’s harder to monetize it sustainably.

**5. Insider Selling Signals Lack of Confidence**  
Executives have been offloading shares at a significant rate. For instance, Chairman Peter Thiel sold a substantial portion of his holdings recently.

[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-lead-sell-palantir-stock-223000919.html)If the leadership team doesn’t see long-term upside at these prices, why should we?



**6. Competitive Pressure Is Mounting**  
Palantir operates in a crowded space with competitors like Snowflake ($SNOW), Databricks, and Microsoft ($MSFT) offering similar or better solutions. Palantir’s dependence on government clients limits its commercial reach in comparison.

**TL;DR:**  
Palantir is an interesting company with solid tech, but the stock price is disconnected from fundamentals. High valuations, slowing growth, heavy SBC, and reliance on government contracts make $PLTR a risky bet at current levels. AI hype has driven the price into bubble territory, and insiders don’t seem confident in its future.

What do you think? Is $PLTR worth its valuation, or are we seeing another overhyped tech bubble? Let’s discuss! 👇

I’ve been keeping an eye on iRobot (IRBT) ever since the Amazon acquisition fell apart, and it’s been rough—stock has dropped hard. But looking at it now, I can’t help but wonder - is it undervalued or will it continue to stagnate?

Workforce cuts and leaner operations:

iRobot recently slashed 40% of its workforce, which makes it leaner and could help with profitability—it’s slowly moving back into the black. But I fear with less people it is also less likely to innovate or move into new territories? 

Intellectual property and general potential of the robotics market:

The company holds a lot of intellectual property in the robotics space, which could still make it an attractive acquisition target down the line. There’s also long-term potential in robotics beyond vacuums—think warehouse automation, which Amazon was allegedly eyeing. The robotics sector still has plenty of room to grow, and iRobot could benefit from broader trends in automation and smart home tech.

No News = No Momentum:

It feels like the company is in limbo. There’s no new product buzz, no big announcements, and management has been quiet. I thing that any good news—be it a new partnership, product, or acquisition interest—could breathe life into the stock. 



What do you think? Do you see potential for the stock to recover?

Since then I have also bought some random stocks, but they stress me out compared with ETFs and when everything was super high recently I sold a couple of them. The gains were only around $1000 but hey that is $1000!

I have just learned about tax loss harvesting (thank you reddit!) and am wondering if I understand:

If I sell everything in my portfolio that is doing badly, the losses will add up to approximately $500. I understand that this $500 could offset tax on the gains, but I don't make much money and will probably pay either 0% or 15% on the gains (let's say 15%, so $150 tax on $1000 gains). That leaves $350 of loss.

The Missing ETF: Why We Need an Institutional Quality Index Fund,1gtsjut,TotallyOrganical,2024-11-18 06:21:32,10,0.66,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gtsjut/the_missing_etf_why_we_need_an_institutional/,"**The Investment Thesis**

Why do some nations prosper while others stagnate? The 2024 Nobel Prize in Economics awarded to Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson answers this fundamental question: institutions make all the difference. Their groundbreaking work ""Why Nations Fail"" demonstrates that inclusive institutions – not geography, culture, or resources – determine a nation's long-term economic success.Yet remarkably, while we can invest in everything from Bitcoin to Butterfly ETFs, no investment vehicle directly tracks what Nobel-winning research identifies as the primary driver of national wealth: institutional quality. This represents not just a gap in the market, but a missed opportunity to align investment capital with the most robust predictor of long-term economic success.

**Why Institutional Quality Matters**

Historical evidence demonstrates that nations with strong institutions exhibit:

* Lower corruption  
* Better property rights protection  
* More efficient markets  
* Higher innovation rates  
* Better capital allocation  
* Greater economic resilience during crises

**The Current Gap in the Market**

While we have:

* ESG-focused ETFs  
* Governance-weighted indices  
* Democracy-weighted funds  
* Country-specific development indices

None directly target institutional quality as their primary investment factor. This represents a significant missed opportunity for long-term investors.

**Proposed ETF Structure**

An Institutional Quality ETF could weight countries based on metrics such as:

* Rule of Law Index (World Justice Project)  
* Property Rights Protection (Heritage Foundation)  
* Institutional Effectiveness (World Bank Governance Indicators) 
* Corruption Perception Index (Transparency International)  
* Economic Freedom Index scores  
* Regulatory Quality metrics

**Benefits Over Traditional Index Funds**

This approach would:

* Naturally avoid autocratic regimes and unstable markets  
* Target countries with sustainable growth potential  
* Reduce exposure to political risk  
* Focus on markets with proven track records of wealth creation  
* Provide built-in ESG compliance through institutional requirements

**Appeal to Different Investor Types**

This ETF would attract:

* Long-term retirement investors  
* ESG-conscious allocators  
* Institutional investors seeking sustainable returns  
* Risk-aware private wealth managers

**Market Timing**

With increasing global focus on:

* Governance quality  
* Democratic values  
* Sustainable development  
* Risk management

The market is primed for an investment vehicle that captures these factors through institutional quality screening.

**My Personal Call to Action**

If you're an ETF provider or institutional investor interested in developing this concept, there's an opportunity to create a first-mover advantage in a potentially significant market segment.The world needs an investment vehicle that aligns capital with good governance.

They’ve given me their financials and a valuation number from 2023 set by independent advisors that I would be able to come in at before the crowdfunding round which would set them at a valuation about 20% higher. After the crowdfunding there is a 6 month lock up on shares. My question is what is the valuation method most often used on a new spirits company like this? I’ve read maybe a measure of velocity, which a large liquor conglomerate would use to see how they could plug in the brand on their huge network and skyrocket sales. I can use some of their data to get a rough revenue per distribution point, but I don’t know how to plug that in to a valuation.

Currently, I have some money in HYSA and that generate a good 4.7% but of course they are taxed and in my case they are taxed heavily.

I started to look at MUB since it is tax free but also the current MUB rates are 3% which are lower than HYSA even after paying the taxes.

So I'm just trying to get ready to invest in MUB in a year when rates of MUB and HYSA are closer.

my concern is, I read that MUB is not liquid as HYSA, I don't understand why? can't I just sell it anytime?

also is there are a relationship between Fed interest rates and MUB rates? meaning when the Fed lower the rates, does it mean MUB rates will also go lower?

I know that there are some data providers that generate macro-based L/S cross sectional factors but it still relatively new and methodology varies by provider. I was interested in a cross-sectional commodity factor, so I built it myself. I've decomposed the US Inflation Swap Curve and Treasury Breakeven Curve to its relevant principal components. Then run a rolling regression on those PCs against most of the commodity futures contracts.

Then I quartiled the betas of each commodity against each PC respectively and built out L/S factors. I also weight the quartiles exponentially and dollar neutral. I update my quartiling every month but rebalance the weights daily.

Surprisingly its the commodities with negative betas that are the ones that perform well, which I didn't expect. This would imply that the compensation for returns is driven by taking on the risk that inflation will drop while it doesn't. I'm not completely sure of this and I'll need to do more work.

Advice for foreign investor living in a high inflation country ,1gsmo84,drmaestro88,2024-11-16 18:24:58,29,0.82,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gsmo84/advice_for_foreign_investor_living_in_a_high/,"Hi,

  
Our country's official inflation rate is high (around 50%, but the real inflation rate is probably higher, maybe close to 80-90%). Does it make sense, in this kind of situation, to invest in foreign index funds? The index funds have probably 8-10% return per year (might go lower if some of the predictions that suggested 3-5% for the next 10 years would turn out to be true) and the USD has increased around 20%, so the cumulative gain in local currency would be around 32%. The yearly interest rate for local currency is around 48%, so in the current situation, investing in foreign index funds seems to be a losing proposition. But also, the interest rates are still lower than true inflation rates, so the best you can do is to protect the value of your investment against inflation, but you are not making any real gains or profits.



At the same time, this creates a funny situation, where you are able to get very high interest rates on US dollars, as there is a difference between US dollar's increase rate (20%) and local  currency interest rates (%48), so if you invest in local currency and then exchange it to USD you get around 35-40% interest in USD. This doesn't seem to be sustainable in the long run.

I am doing a personal research to understand the retail investing landscape. The post-COVID surge in retail investing appears to be more than a temporary trend, with continued growth suggesting a fundamental shift in wealth-building mindsets. More individuals now recognize investing, rather than traditional employment alone, as a crucial path to financial growth.

This cohort of investors are becoming a powerful force to be reckoned with. Public companies are highly susceptible to the power of the retail investors, [47% of whom want to be “more involved”](https://www.bnymellon.com/content/dam/bnymellon/documents/pdf/insights/the-state-of-the-us-retail-investor.pdf) in the companies they invest in and 58% voting their proxies to make their voices heard.

I am interested to dig deeper into the individual stock picker cohort a bit more. Myself being an active investor I have a couple of stocks that I own and manage. I do fundamental analysis as well as actively keep up-to date with the latest news, attend investor calls and what not. But I do feel that the communication feels a bit one way sometimes and would be great if there was a way to actively engage with the companies I invest it.

Trying to gauge if this is just a me thing or something much more of a broader phenomena.

# Introduction: Setting the Stage

Amazon’s growth trajectory is very strong, driven by its diversified business model, innovations, and a focus on long-term growth. The company’s performance in recent quarters shows its resilience even with challenges. An important factor in all of this is Amazon’s success in Amazon Web Services (AWS). In Q3 2024, AWS generated $10 billion in operating income, which is 60% of Amazon’s total operating income. This shows the role that AWS plays in Amazon’s growth and financial success, strengthening the company’s valuation and protecting it from the general volatility in e-commerce. AWS’s high-margin business model has allowed Amazon to expand profit while also maintaining growth, further making the company a dominant player in cloud computing. AWS continues to outperform expectations as Amazon’s e-commerce is steadily growing. The company’s outlook remains strong, providing confidence in its growth potential.

**AWS Segment Overview and Profit Growth**

AWS has significantly impacted Amazon’s growth and valuation by transforming the company’s business model and driving profitability beyond its core e-commerce operations. As Amazon’s cloud computing arm, AWS has consistently contributed a major share of Amazon’s operating income, thanks to its high margins relative to the low-margin retail business. In 2023, AWS generated over $80 billion in revenue, representing about 16%-18% of Amazon's total revenue and underscoring its role as a key financial driver. This reliable revenue stream not only offsets the volatile nature of retail but has also contributed to Amazon’s robust valuation by positioning it as a dominant player in the rapidly expanding cloud computing market. AWS’s growth is further supported by strategic partnerships with major clients like T-Mobile, Toyota, and Epic Games, which highlight its adaptability across industries—from enhancing 5G infrastructure and automotive technologies to providing advanced computing for game development. These contracts not only bolster AWS’s revenue but also reinforce Amazon’s brand as a tech innovator, driving investor confidence and contributing to Amazon’s overall market value. AWS has become a major factor in Amazon's financial success, having a huge impact on the company’s profits. In Q3 2024, for instance, AWS generated $10.4 billion in operating income—a 50% increase from the previous year. AWS makes up 60% of the company’s total operating income and has an operating margin of 38%. These statistics show how AWS operates and uses its large scale to keep costs low. 

**Q3 Earnings Results and Beating Estimates**

Amazon’s retail division experienced notable growth in Q3, with North American sales rising 9% year-over-year (YoY) to $95.5 billion and international sales increasing 12% YoY to $35.9 billion, outperforming the previous quarter’s growth rates of 9% and 7%, respectively. This growth reflects sustained consumer demand, particularly in Prime subscriptions and eCommerce, alongside a steady increase in third-party marketplace sales. In North America, 2023 revenue grew by 7.9% YoY, from $315 billion in 2022 to $340 billion, with operating profit rising 22.2% from $18 billion to $22 billion, driven by enhanced logistics networks, higher cost-efficiency, and high-margin services like Prime. Operating margins in North America improved significantly, reaching 5.9%, showcasing Amazon’s ability to leverage its infrastructure for increased profitability. Meanwhile, international sales grew more moderately by 5.0% YoY, from $140 billion in 2022 to $147 billion in 2023, as economic conditions and logistics costs across diverse markets tempered growth. While international operating profit rose slightly from $5 billion to $5.2 billion, margins remained constrained by global expansion costs and currency fluctuations, though they turned positive in Q3, reaching 3.6%, up from a negative 0.3% last year. Amazon’s logistics optimization, such as regional fulfillment centers, has played a key role in reducing shipping costs and enhancing delivery speed, benefiting profitability in both segments. To address slower international profit growth, Amazon may need to focus on automation, cost-effective delivery, and leveraging AWS to strengthen its margins further.

**Forecast for Q4 and Beyond**

Amazon is poised for strong Q4 growth, driven by robust consumer spending and increased holiday season sales. Net sales are expected to grow significantly, with projections ranging from $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion, marking a 7% to 11% increase over the previous year. This reflects the company’s ability to leverage seasonal demand and capitalize on strategic promotions, including discounts and exclusive deals. Compared to two years ago, when net sales stood at $149.2 billion, this quarter’s projected performance highlights a substantial growth trajectory, supported by the ongoing expansion of e-commerce and enhanced logistics capabilities. Additionally, operating income is anticipated to rise in tandem with sales, underscoring the profitability of holiday-driven demand. In the last quarter of the 2024 year, Amazon’s performance, specifically its growth, will likely be due to its top-performing areas, AWS and Amazon Prime. AWS provides large amounts of profit from its cloud computing technology, services that are only expected to improve Amazon’s standing as many companies are beginning to utilize it as they expand into more modern cloud services. Additionally, Prime’s investments in more warehouses and improved delivery systems, both contributing to faster product delivery, directly contributes to the projected growth of Amazon as a whole. Adaptations to Prime’s entertainment and streaming content have begun to be based on regional preferences, increasing subscriptions and therefore company revenue. In the long term, Amazon’s growth internationally will be a big factor in its overall success. By expanding Prime benefits in regions like Asia, Latin America, and Europe, Amazon is adjusting its services to fit local needs, including faster delivery, special shopping events, and more region-specific streaming content. While there are some challenges, like high delivery costs and currency changes, Amazon’s focus on building efficient delivery systems and offering local content for Prime members is setting it up to win over more customers globally. These efforts should help Amazon grow steadily and strengthen its presence worldwide in the years to come.

**Impact of Falling Inflation on Amazon**

As inflation rates continue to fall, Amazon stands to benefit from increased consumer spending power, especially in discretionary categories such as electronics and household goods. Lower inflation means that consumers’ purchasing power is less eroded by price increases, encouraging more frequent and larger purchases. This shift can translate into stronger revenue growth for Amazon, particularly as the holiday season approaches, when spending naturally spikes. The added spending capacity from a lower inflation environment could help Amazon meet or exceed its Q4 projections and reinforce its market position. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) slowed to 3.7% in September 2024, down from 9.1% in 2022, while the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index also eased to 3.5% in August. This has led to increased consumer spending, with personal consumption expenditures growing 3.2% annually in Q2 2024. Retail sales rose 4.4% in August, driven by demand for higher-ticket items. With more disposable income, consumers are likely to spend more on non-essential goods, positioning Amazon to benefit from this shift, particularly as the holiday season approaches.

**Seasonal Boost from Holiday Sales**

Amazon’s season of growth and income is during late Q4 or the holiday season in lay man’s terms. In the United States, retail business generally sees an incredible boost, due to the consumerist culture of holiday season in America. Amazon and other stores like Ebay, Best Buy, and more have embraced this by giving out solid deals on common items gifted during the holidays. Electronics, toys, and clothing are the most common discounted items during this season, with that making up the majority of items on sale during this period. American retailers have caught up to this, creating masterful promotions informing consumers about the deals on popular products going on during the holidays. Amazon is one of the leaders in this section, with the festive decor lining the site, to the well-placed advertisements, to even the special packaging. The most important day of this part of Q4, is Black Friday. Black Friday, for those who don’t know, is a holiday in America which is on the day after Thanksgiving. Black Friday is seen as a holiday at the shops, where numerous stores will bring heavy discounts on a large variety of items. Black Friday is important to consumers, due to its prime location near the beginning on the chaotic run to Christmas and other early winter holidays. Amazon has mostly focused on Cyber Monday, a day on the Monday after thanksgiving week oriented to online shopping, but as the in-store culture of Black Friday goes down Amazon has been promoting Black Friday more heavily. This is a critical time for the Washington State based company as Black Friday only flourishes when the economy is booming, and with many Americans having issues monetarily companies will need to bring out more lucrative offers and advertising to win over customers. Last year, Amazon was able to bring in almost $10 Billion from Black Friday alone, making investors very cheerful during the holiday season. This year, if Amazon is able to recreate it’s smart advertising based in holiday cheer, solid deals, and build hype, they will easily move past the challenges being faced by American citizens.

**Conclusion**

# Amazon's projected temple of growth and profitability domonstrates that the company is armed with strategies that will enable it come out bigger and better in the end. E-commerce growth strengthened by logistics, together with personalization of shopping, cuts into the consumer's loyalty and market share. It is also noted that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a profit center all its own due to its very high margins and strong market demands for cloud services.The article continues with the growth of Amazon's ad business, collecting targeted consumer data at low cost, as other income streams eg: Prime subscriptions and services for third-party sellers. All these bring about large amounts of cash and help retain customers. Global expansion to those lesser-explored geographical markets would eventually provide Amazon an opportunity for long-term growth by entering customers neeing U.S. and European saturation. Sustainability initiatives will resonate with the consumers' eco-responsible inclinations, which will help build brand loyalty and reduce costs over time.Not the least of which, innovation is part of the great Amazon EQ; investments made on innovation are always on AI, automation, and some machine learning processes to enable efficiency and open the door for other opportunities while fortifying the competition.

  


**TLDR**: Amazon is known for being an outstanding leader in e-commerce, and cloud computing which has been displayed through its recent profit growth and Q3 earnings. With these factors, Amazon is positioned to continue its growth in Q4 as it leverages holiday sales and AWS offerings making it a good buying opportunity.",2024-11-15,0.9999,Positive,"['AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'CPI', 'PCE', 'AWS', 'EQ', 'AI', 'TLDR', 'AWS']"

I also pay money into a saving scheme that we call Kiwisaver, it's basically employers invest a % into your kiwisaver every pay, I put in a % every pay and govt adds $1k per year into it. So far I've just hit 100k of savings. This investment is designed to assist with buying a first home, I rent currently, or of course you can pull it out at retirement.

I've not lived quite a healthy life, so my expectations of living long I'm fairly aware of, i'd say I will reach retirement (65) but will most likely flake out by max 80 haha. I'm ok with that.

Anyways, my plan was to through $500 a week at the investment and just build it up after the next 20-30 years and hopefully by the time I CBF working any more, I can cruise on that + pension until the hangman comes for me.

I guess I want to ensure that is enough, I don't expect to be rich or living lavishly in retirement, but I want to be comfortable, I guess the question around that is ""what is comfortable cost wise in your country and more importantly in those particular years and things change as we go through time.

However should I be doing more around different investment types? I know NZ has big issues with tax around stocks that pay dividends, but I don't know enough to even start researching the right paths to actually learn and start doing it.

I will be doing internship as a junior in college where I should be able to save 4k / month, right now I have a brokerage account and a Roth IRA that I opened to start investing when I start getting paid. I was thinking of maxing out my IRA with more aggressive LETFs like QLD and only investing in VOO in my brokerage since I will be investing much more in my brokerage so I want to take less risk whereas my IRA from what I read at my age it would be better to be more aggressive since the potential returns are much higher and it would be tax free. 

I was also wondering if I should be some money in a regular savings account as well that would be easier to take out if needed (I’m fortunate enough to have my parents behind me in case of an emergency so not sure if I need a savings account). 

 Looking for advice on what I think of investing in, also would it be smart to not invest everything at once and keep some to continue investing next year in case the market goes down so I can lower my average price since I won’t be making any money until summer 2026 after this one.

Here’s a question in English about investing in stocks for the long term:

“If you start with an investment of $800,000 in either the S&P 500 or Nasdaq, assuming an average annual return of around 10% based on historical performance over the last 20 years, and encounter a market crash of 50% in year ten, what would the final value of the investment be after 20 years?”

This question outlines the initial investment, average return assumption, and the hypothetical mid-term crash, asking for the final outcome based on these conditions. According to my calculations the result will be with 10% interest and a crash of 50% in year 10 you will have approx 2,7 millions in total after 20 years of not spending time in the stocks.

Municipal bonds and portfolio fees,1gr1zxl,Special_North1535,2024-11-14 16:08:06,0,0.43,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gr1zxl/municipal_bonds_and_portfolio_fees/,"Hello! New to the group and first time posting. Question for the group-
I have most of my net worth in a portfolio with a financial advisor. I gave him my cash 4 years ago and we purchased 95% municipal bonds and 5% equities. Portfolio yielding 4.5% basically tax free. Missed the boat a few times rolling the bonds into equities over the last few years but no crystal ball and not looking to risk the potential once in a lifetime cash influx. 40 year old male, debt free, other real estate investments that do not yield income. Some crypto. 

My question- so my advisor made commissions when he bought the bonds and has not charged me anything above those commissions for the last 4 years. He is now leaving the firm and is changing my account to a fee structure of 40 basis points, which equates to 10% of the fixed income generated by the account. The bonds are all long term, 10 years minimum to maturity, and I don’t plan on selling them early, unless the market retreats 20-30%… Is it worth paying the 40 basis points to just watch these bonds sit there for the next 1-2 decades yielding fixed income? I feel like i can just move them to my fidelity account and not pay the 40 basis points, especially since i don’t plan on liquidating them any time soon. 
I draw monthly from the yields for expenses and plan to take any additional cash generated and buy specific dividend bearing blue chip stocks and mutual funds on fidelity. I have a very knowledgeable accountant and estate planner that can hopefully help navigate the more complicated aspects of all this. Really have not received any advice from my advisor since we bought the bonds other than to sell all my crypto and roll into bonds.. lol 

Thanks!!

Rebalancing Premium… Argument for Bitcoin?,1gqw3yo,Swole_Bodry,2024-11-14 09:20:28,0,0.4,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gqw3yo/rebalancing_premium_argument_for_bitcoin/,"Rebalancing Premium… Argument for Bitcoin?

I’ve learned something recently that IMO might justify a Bitcoin position, or gold, any position in any volatile, non capital producing asset.

If we assume that an asset is volatile, it follows that it must have a positive expected arithmetic return. By holding a fixed size position and rebalancing regularly, you can capture this return. This idea applies to all assets, where the “rebalancing premium” is the difference between an asset’s geometric and arithmetic returns. But for assets with high volatility, and especially those with skewed returns, the rebalancing strategy you use can significantly affect the investment outcome, but the asset must be uncorrelated with the other assets in your portfolio.

I’ve been very critical of Bitcoin, gold, or other commodities, and those criticisms hold true if you never rebalance, but you can capture the arithmetic return assuming systematic rebalancing. The only bottle neck is costs which you need to consider.

So hypothetically 2 assets with a 0% expected CAGR, but is volatile and uncorrelated with one another, could generate a positive return through systematic rebalancing. 

Assuming 0% CAGR, equal volatility, and 0 correlation, the Geometric mean of the rebalanced portfolio = 1/2 σ^2, despite each individual asset having 0% geometric mean on their own.

Take a second to look at the pictures I have attached. I’ve coded this python script with two random walks to simulate assets. These are by no means a perfect reflection of financial markets, but it is an effective simulation at demonstrating the rebalancing premium in action.

See the t test for 100 trials of the simulated assets. Both portfolios start at 50/50 weight. The unbalanced portfolio allowed the weights to vary through the duration of the time series, while the other rebalanced the assets back to 50/50 every 30 days. The results were clear. The rebalanced portfolios had a statistically meaningfully higher return than the unrebalanced ones.

This is the best, and frankly the only good argument for Bitcoin  in my opinion, seeing that Bitcoin is highly volatile and relatively uncorrelated with traditional investment vehicles you’re sitting on a pretty large rebalancing premium, despite a non existent CAGR expectation. Just be careful of fees and skewness :)",2024-11-14,0.9932,Positive,"['IMO', 'CAGR', 'CAGR', 'CAGR']"

""Pigs get slaughtered"" -- what's a sensible strategy to avoid this fate?

For years I never touched margin.  Then I saw some opportunities since June and took the plunge.  It's paid off handsomely.

YTD, I'm up 108%.  $247k is now $520k.  That's $273k profit for the year.  Approx $130k of which is attributable to using margin.

Margin fees are at about $8k in my account.  So for the moment, that math is a slam dunk.  HOWEVER, if we see a downturn, say my portfolio drops to $250k and stays there for a year or more, $190k in margin usage will drag on my account heavily at 11.325% annual interest.

Honestly, I'd liquidate heavily January 1st if it weren't for fear of triggering taxes.  But I also haven't ruled out that possibility.  I already realized $73k in long term gains this year which will be at the 0% tax rate.",2024-11-14,0.8452,Positive,['YTD']

We're talking about losses of thousands of dollars per month, which means over the course of the past few years after the interest rates went up, the portfolio probably has lost tens of thousands of dollars. I'm guessing at least 100K based on the trend I'm seeing.

Does a CFP has any obligation to sell bonds if the portfolio is losing that much money due to these bonds?

If no, then just please explain how it does not breach a fiduciary duty. Again this is a serious question, I'm not trying to be difficult.

Index fund investing has been the holy grail of stock investing since its inception. It has been working well for everybody. However it could become a bubble as some experts pointed out. When there are many and constant passive buy pressure regardless of the price, the stocks in the index lost the ability to price discover. This leads to bubble/over value.

New reporting indicates they will make a hard push to do just that, and are building a theory of their case that is counter to the beliefs of economists. 

Hopefully this information helps some plan their next investing steps; it will certainly be shaping my approach.

President-elect Donald Trump’s former trade chief and those close to him are preparing to aggressively sell their plans for massive new tariffs on imports that will go far beyond anything seen in Trump’s first term.

Advisers close to Lighthizer and the Trump transition also have been talking to key lawmakers and congressional staff about how Congress might even take a role in imposing the incoming administration’s tariff plans through legislation — an action that would signify a break from mainstream economic policymaking embraced by both parties for decades, but would also prevent the tariffs from being unilaterally revoked by a future president.
The economic justification for the tariffs could be released by Trump allies in the coming weeks, said the person, and will show “the failures of economic models to accurately predict changes to the economy” as a result of tariffs. Trump’s proposals, which aim to promote domestic manufacturing and lessen reliance on foreign countries, include a “universal” tariff of up to 20 percent on all goods coming into the U.S. and at least a 60 percent tariff on all imports from China.

Since then, the stock went up 25% in about 13 trading sessions, adding roughly $40B of enterprise value.

Excluding interest gained on cash, the company now trades at 450x operating income. Many companies experience this only when their earnings are swinging wildly from year to year - but palantir really just is this expensive.

By buying a share of Palantir now, you have the privilege of laying claim to a whopping $1.19 in revenue and $0,16 of operating income on a $76 share price.

Eli Lilly (LLY): Dominating the Obesity Market with Innovation and Expansion,1h7w487,Pawel_9,2024-12-06 13:04:23,5,0.63,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h7w487/eli_lilly_lly_dominating_the_obesity_market_with/,"About LLY

Eli Lilly and Company, founded in 1876 and headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, develops and markets pharmaceuticals globally. Key products include diabetes treatments (e.g., Humalog, Jardiance, Trulicity), obesity drugs (e.g., Zepbound), oncology medications (e.g., Verzenio, Alimta), and therapies for autoimmune and neurological conditions (e.g., Olumiant, Taltz, Emgality). The company also offers Cialis for erectile dysfunction and Forteo for osteoporosis. Lilly operates the Lilly Seaport Innovation Center focused on RNA/DNA-based therapies and collaborates with various biotech firms.


Strong Market Position and Research Successes

Recent comparative study results have shown that Zepbound outperforms its competitor Wegovy from Novo Nordisk, achieving a 20.2% weight loss over 72 weeks, compared to Wegovy’s 13.7%. These findings further strengthen Eli Lilly's competitive position in the obesity treatment market, where it's facing tough competition from Novo Nordisk. The company’s expanded production capacity, including resolving the tirzepatide shortage, puts it in a great position to speed up its market share growth.

Growth Strategy and Production Expansion

Lilly continues to heavily invest in boosting its production capacity, committing an additional $2 billion to its Lilly Medicine Foundry project, increasing its earlier investment of $4.5 billion. The company’s focus on penetrating the U.S. market, introducing single-dose vials, and strategically expanding its production capabilities highlights its commitment to meeting the rapidly growing demand for GLP-1 products. Solving the tirzepatide availability issue also reduces competition from compounded drugs.

Distribution Channels and Innovations

Lilly has a strong drug distribution network in the obesity and diabetes treatment space, with promising candidates like retatrutide (24% weight loss in 48 weeks) and orforglipron (nearly 10% weight loss in 36 weeks). These next-gen products could help Lilly maintain its leadership position as the GLP-1 market grows and new competitors enter the scene.

**DD Research**

**What is Rubrik ?** 

* Rubrik is a backup & recovery provider that sits on top of a company’s cloud infrastructure.

**What is an example of Backup & Recovery I can maybe understand?** 

* You drop your phone under a tire because you were to busy while parking, leading to a smashing of both it and the SIM card. The only fix is you buy a new phone, login with your iCloud email, and everything is restored from the cloud.
* Rubrik does the above and sells at-cost servers from partners like Dell, HPE, SMCI, etc. They protect data in places like AWS , Azure, and GCP.
* People pay whatever when they have no phone or car. Same here.

**How are you qualified?** 

* I worked at a research company for five years partnering with SaaS vendors $5M-$250M, for two of those years I CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY they may have been a client.
* I transitioned to Software Engineering three years ago from Tech Sales. I have tracked them and understand both the sales pitch and technology pitch. 
* I saw them masterfully navigate researchers, which they still do, and become the golden child. Billions of dollars get validated by researchers.... it's importants.
   * [(Updated) They Poached the Magic in 2018](https://www.theregister.com/2018/05/01/rubrik_gartner_hires/). One is doable but not three of them it delayed the research paper a year that doesn’t happen unless a research analyst dies.
   * [(Updated) Because of 2018 poaching the late Fall report never got published (major delay), The 2019 Report Was Fought Back By Rubrik for Flawed Data](https://www.crn.com/news/storage/rubrik-ceo-gartner-data-center-magic-quadrant-seriously-flawed) . I've never seen a CEO do this without blowback Bipul again with a killer move.
   * TL:DR; They were making moves YEARS ago. See article excerpt below.

[This is pretty rare, vendors complain but not publishing a document read by 4k+ CIO controlling the flow of billions of dollars in a sector. It's just insane. There's a lot of big names backing them. ](https://preview.redd.it/x3hcumds365e1.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f1e26b7a5f66134efaf4447b77fa18f020f0837)

**Who’s in the market? Competitors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/qq3hhafdg55e1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20d4d8a57db7467d15ffd2abaa24459d6ac8d60c

* Their only publicly traded competitor is Commvault which is around $170 and dropping.
* Veeam and Cohesity are private firms with very different architectures, support qualities, and applications. Rubrik is the only one fully doing what it does. They are considered the “Lexus”

**How are they different?** 

* Rubrik views backup and recovery very differently from legacy vendors. They built their architecture based on expecting to get hacked (Backup & Recovery) vs. trying to prevent a hack (Incident Response). It's never been done ""their way"" before.
* Rubrik creates an air gapped layer on top of databases that - even if a hacker gets in they’re quarantined and the user can restore the system cutting them off. Thus less downtime, less support costs, payroll, legal fees, etc.
* They are very partner friendly with Mandiant, Crowdstrike, and Zscaler at least in the cutthroat cyber industry. 
* Rubrik’s leadership , in particular the CEO Bipul Sinha, are not run of the mill. Bipul is personally a very kind, measured, and calculated leader, I’ve met him before. He’s a lovely man but a killer. He’s an engineer with a sales streak like Elon. Bipul has Nutanix and Bromium under his belt. Google Him. He essentially came out of retirement for this company from a cushy ass VC job. 
* They know how to pitch investors, analysts, sales people, clients, basically everyone. They’re as buttoned up as you get and they come to impress. They earned their street cred 100%. 
* They have consistently ranked as #1 according to Gartner in the Magic Quadrant. Beating out companies with very, very large balance sheets that don't have the balls to IPO in 2024.

**Why the sudden pop? (Things I thought were important)** 

* Analysts needed another leap to profitability  due to the only available historicals  being from the April 2024 IPO and September Q2 earnings. This gave them pause on profitability as Rubrik as high operating margin.
* They raised 2025 Guidance. Indicated profitability by end of next year on this Q3 Earnings.
* Things I Heard on their Q3 Earnings today:
   * They mentioned a Fortune 50 Healthcare company selecting them in a competitive win. UnitedHealthcare was hacked in February and had offline billing systems for like 20 days. I’m thinking they signed UNH, that’s a big cookie boys. It’s super fucking hard to rip and replace a legacy vendor. 
   * They passed $1B in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). This is a big metric. I heard both the Goldman Sachs and Barclays analysts say “Congrats” they seemed to be teeing up easier questions.   
* [Everyone and their mother in Cybersecurity has heard of Rubrik. They got the same award as Google, Facebook, and others a month ago for Entrepreneurship](https://www.rubrik.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/24/rubrik-named-the-2024-entrepreneurial-company-of-the-year-by-the-harvard-business-school-hbs-association-of-northern-california)

**Why did the stock not move from April to September 2024? (Timeline Below...)**

* **April 24th 2024 IPO Financials**
   *  Rubrik reveals a very high operating margin due to sales and marketing investments aka ripping out Zscaler’s sales team doing the “Salesforce” push. Blitzkreg the market. 
   * I believe they started  planning ripping Zscaler in October 2023 , it takes time to ramp up. They probably got all big sales hires in by March with a six month ramp up take lands sales quotes around September when the stock crept up(
   * [Sniping Zscaler Executives and Top Earners in October 2023. They had to give a fuck ton of stock to pry these boys away. ](https://channeleye.co.uk/rubrik-hires-another-zscaler/)
   * [EDIT: (Updated with New Video) This lead to analyst skepticism about pricing controls. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzEhqtSrVUE) 
* **Septemeber 9th 2024 Q2 Earnings Financials** 
   * Earnings were month after the late July 2024 Crowdstrike hack, I do not think Rubrik was able to accelerate deal velocity to report ARR high enough to relieve market analysts and critics of the operating margin. They were asked about “deal velocity” by analysts today and it seems like the markets are pleased. 
   * [Bloomberg video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGvI0QbzzkY) from post-earnings is killer and a good recap of market sentiment.
   * [Rubrik Search Trends Peaked In April Coinciding With the Major UNH Hack; however, they droped off after the huge spike.](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=rubrik&hl=en)
      * I think analysts expected a quicker deal cycle around the UNH hack, 4 months/120 days is a very fast enterprise sales cycle. Most large sales deals can take 6-12 months if not longer.
* **October 2024:** 
   * I believe deal velocity picked up from the UNH hack and even with low search results, the three week hack fallout was enough to start sales cycles. Then from the Crowdstrike fallout, even as a partner, highlighted the need to immediately solve it as publicly traded companies were literally offline, no one working.
   * Remember 60-120 days is a very fast sales cycle on any software sale. I think this is where we started heating up here as this is three months out from the hack.  
   * Today on earnings analysts seemed eager to ask about profitability as the CFO and CEO were comfortable to voice the 2026 is the year. Look there's alot of tech companies with -40 EPS floating around. It's not 2013-2018 you can't float on negative earnings and millions of users. <--- the market is speaking, you have to make money as a tech company.
* **November 2024:** 
   * Rising cybersecurity risk from election, TikTok hack, etc. Fidelity even paused my money for four weeks in a CMA because they had security issues with fraud. 
   * Stock was ticking up.
* **December 4th, 2024  (Yesterday):**
   * Veeam $2B announcement mentioned earlier.
   * Volume doubles to nearly 2M. It was 700k in July 2024. It's 4M Today. Nuts.

**Where will it go?**

Callaway (MODG) Nears a 5-Year Low Despite Potential TopGolf Sale: A Huge Opportunity?,1h7muzn,King0fTheNorthh,2024-12-06 04:46:12,7,0.89,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h7muzn/callaway_modg_nears_a_5year_low_despite_potential/,"
Callaway (MODG), which owns brands like TopGolf, Callaway, TravisMathew, Odyssey, OGIO, Jack Wolfskin, and World Golf Tour, is currently trading near a 5-year low—even though there's a strong possibility that TopGolf will be sold or spun off. The CEO has repeatedly stated that the company is exploring options, including a sale.

In 2021, Callaway acquired TopGolf for $2.6 billion. Today, the combined company has a market cap of just $1.48 billion. If Callaway manages to sell TopGolf for even close to what they paid for it, the market cap could easily double.

Furthermore, Callaway has $443 million in cash and is currently valued at only a third of its closest competitor, Titleist (GOLF), while being down 78% from its all-time high.

Despite suffering a brutal decline in recent years, the potential sale of TopGolf could serve as a catalyst for a major turnaround.

Got scared for life. Never shorting these Chinese P&Ds ever again,1h7l88h,udhjdubcmj,2024-12-06 03:34:31,21,0.84,23,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h7l88h,"Had a great morning being up around $600 trading my usual options scalps. Saw this POS halted up around 1 pm EST from the $7.20 dump. Shorted only 100 shares at $12 thinking of making quick $50 - $100 bucks. Fumbled my buy back order at $11. This POS just kept halting up. Placed another short order for 100 shares at $20. When the trade resumed again, that short order got filled and the stock got halted again around 1:30 pm EST. That was the LAST halt for the day. The trading didn't resume until the after hours.

Since that halt, the past 2.5 hours have been the most stressful time of my trading career. I saw the Limit Up keep climbing up from like $24 to eventually $50+ at the market close. What was more scary is that the bid-ask match was showing an opening price around $110 - $120. I even saw it briefly get up to $180 at some point. Got scared to death thinking about another Chinese POS jump to $200 after hours from being long halted around $20 in a similar fashion last week Tuesday (that stock is now trading under $2). If my position would have opened above $100 after hours today, my $30k margin account would have definitely be blown up as Webull would have liquidated my short position.

Thankfully, the POS opened at $60 after hours and instantly kept dumping. Before I could even press the button to close my position around $30 for a ~100% loss, it crashed below $10. Changed my buy back order to $10 and the order got filled around $9.5 making me a profit.

I would not be posting here if I had to close the position at $55 - $60 like I was thinking near the market close (or at an even worse price above $100 blowing up my account). I don't know what I would be doing. The market has given me a second chance, and I am just... relieved. Don't know how to process all these right now. All I know is that I am never gonna short shares of another penny stock or meme stock (or any stock actually) risking unlimited losses (stop-loss orders don't really work in halt up or downs) for meager returns. Options scalping works for me - the risks are defined — that's what I should stick to. If I trade shares, that will be only long. Even if the stock goes to 0, I only lose -100% of my position. But with shorts, I am really just one crazy irrational pump away from blowing up my account. So, NO!

"DD: Long China ETFs (YINN, CHAU) + PDD Calls – Stimulus Incoming 🚀🚀",1h7e8ph,jazzjaswal,2024-12-05 22:44:38,11,0.7,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h7e8ph/dd_long_china_etfs_yinn_chau_pdd_calls_stimulus/,"**TL;DR:** China is expected to announce significant economic stimulus measures during the **Central Economic Work Conference** on **December 11-12, 2024**. This anticipation has led to substantial call option activity in Chinese leveraged ETFs **YINN** and **CHAU**. I'm bullish on these ETFs and **PDD** calls, aiming to capitalize on the potential market surge. 🐉

**The Setup:**

1. **Stimulus Anticipation:** The Chinese government is poised to unveil major economic stimulus initiatives during the upcoming Central Economic Work Conference. Historically, such announcements have positively impacted Chinese markets.
2. **Unusual Options Activity:**
   * **YINN:** Over 98,000 call options with a $27 strike price expiring in January 2026 were traded recently, with an additional 38,000 calls traded shortly after. [GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2620900/unusual-surge-in-call-options-for-chinese-etfs-chau-and-yinn?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
   * **CHAU:** More than 200,000 call options, allowing the purchase of 20 million shares at $15 each by mid-May next year, totaling $55 million, have been bought. This is notable given CHAU's usual low options trading volume. [GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2620900/unusual-surge-in-call-options-for-chinese-etfs-chau-and-yinn?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**The Technicals:**

* **YINN:** Currently trading near $28.12. A breakout above $30 could target $35+.
* **CHAU:** Trading around $15.31. Surpassing $16 could lead to $18+.
* **PDD:** With support around $95, options strategies targeting $110-$120 strikes could be profitable.

**Catalyst Timeline:**

1. **December 11-12:** Expected stimulus announcement during the Central Economic Work Conference.
2. **Improving U.S.-China Relations:** Recent diplomatic engagements have eased tensions, potentially benefiting Chinese equities.

**Risks:**

* **Underwhelming Stimulus:** If the announced measures fall short of expectations, markets may react negatively.
* **Geopolitical Tensions:** Ongoing issues, such as potential U.S. regulatory changes affecting Chinese companies, could impact stock performance.
* **Market Volatility:** Leveraged ETFs like YINN and CHAU can experience significant price swings.

**My Position:**

* **YINN Calls:** Jan 17th 30 strike at $2.45
* **PDD Calls:** Jan 17th $120 strike at $1.0

Chargepoint - AKA What is the point of bothering with tangible assets???,1h7685a,habitualpotatoes,2024-12-05 16:00:51,0,0.5,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h7685a/chargepoint_aka_what_is_the_point_of_bothering/,"How the thunderation of thunderations of thunderations (thanks LeoAI for that one) does ChargePoint still have $214m of goodwill on its books?? This is 22% of all its assets.

Blink dropped their 10Q a month ago with a similar ratio 24%, but had written off about half of the goodwill year on year based on share price indicating loss of value.

EVgo is sitting there with 4% goodwill doing the same thing.

To be clear, they acquired this goodwill in FY 2021 and it has stayed over the $200m mark since then. The share price at the point of the October 21 figures when goodwill appeared (thanks to acquisitions) was $24+ v $1.22 today (with some dilution).

If goodwill followed the loss in share price across the same time, they would have around $20m of goodwill left on the books and the **liabilities would outweigh it's assets AND IT WOULD BE INSOLVENT!!!** 

I know it's not a linear correlation between the two lines, but bejesus, surely there must be an expectation that tangible value would be realised from an intangible goodwill value over a long enough timeframe, otherwise what the F is the point of recording a goodwill value in the first place.

Expect to see this company hoovered up from administration in '25 when the Federal funding of EV charging roll-out to states is stopped, CHPT take a write-down on inventory value and can't afford to use their revolving credit facility.

DD: Canaan (CAN) buy the company that sells the top miners to  companies like MARA and CLSK,1h73f46,WhiteHatDoc,2024-12-05 12:33:46,21,0.78,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h73f46/dd_canaan_can_buy_the_company_that_sells_the_top/,"Canaan (CAN): The Bitcoin Gold Rush Pickaxe Play 💎⛏️

In the 19th-century gold rush, the real winners were the ones selling tools—picks, shovels, and axes. Today, in the digital gold rush of Bitcoin, Canaan Inc. (CAN) plays a similar role, providing the essential hardware that powers cryptocurrency mining operations worldwide.

The Hashrate Arms Race

Publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies are scaling up their operations to increase hashrate—the computational power used to mine Bitcoin and process transactions. This race is driven by the need to secure more mining rewards and maintain profitability as mining difficulty rises.

Canaan is uniquely positioned to profit from this expansion as mining companies continue to demand high-performance hardware for their growing operations.

Recent Industry Expansions and Acquisitions

	•	Marathon Digital Holdings: Acquired two operational Bitcoin mining sites in December 2023, totaling 390 megawatts of capacity, for $178.6 million.
	•	CleanSpark Inc.: In October 2024, acquired GRIID Infrastructure Inc., significantly expanding its mining capacity in Tennessee.
	•	Riot Platforms: Acquired Block Mining in July 2024, boosting its total power capacity to 2 gigawatts.

These expansions highlight the growing demand for efficient and cost-effective mining hardware—a market Canaan serves directly.

Canaan’s Strategic Position

Canaan’s AvalonMiner series is designed to meet the needs of both large-scale and smaller mining operations. Here’s how it compares to key competitors:

	•	AvalonMiner A1246: 90 TH/s hash rate with 38 J/TH efficiency.

	•	Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro: 110 TH/s with 30 J/TH efficiency.

	•	MicroBT Whatsminer M30S++: 112 TH/s with 31 J/TH efficiency.

While competitors lead in raw performance, Canaan’s hardware offers strong value through competitive pricing and accessibility. This balance positions Canaan as a key player in the mining hardware supply chain, particularly for cost-conscious operations.

Recent Bullish Developments

Canaan has also secured large purchase agreements from major mining companies:

	•	HIVE Digital Technologies: Ordered 5,000 Avalon A15-194T miners (194 TH/s each) after a previous order for 6,500 Avalon A1566 miners.

	•	Cipher Mining Technologies: Purchased 6,600 Avalon A1566 miners earlier in 2024.

	•	The recent order of 3,800 Avalon A1566I Immersion Cooling Miners from CleanSpark underscores the growing demand for Canaan's cutting-edge technology. This large-scale adoption by industry players signals a vote of confidence in Canaan's ability to meet the evolving needs of the mining sector

These deals highlight the demand for Canaan’s hardware and its ability to cater to large-scale operations.

Conclusion

In the escalating competition among Bitcoin miners, Canaan profits as the supplier of essential hardware. As mining companies expand through acquisitions and infrastructure development, Canaan’s position as a key provider makes it well-suited to capitalize on the industry’s growth.

TL;DR: Canaan isn’t mining Bitcoin—they’re selling the tools miners need. As the mining industry grows, so do Canaan’s opportunities. Miners compete, Canaan profits. NFA.",2024-12-05,0.9948,Positive,"['CAN', 'CAN', 'GRIID', 'TH', 'TH', 'TH', 'TH', 'TH', 'TH', 'HIVE', 'TH', 'TL', 'DR', 'NFA']"

This is a sure thing

[Dumped my entire TFSA into PDD yesterday](https://i.imgur.com/ileUaxN.png)

As a guy in his 20s, this TFSA is (basically) all I got. Spent years building this account. I tossed everything in there.

###DD

Am pure-blooded Chinese. Grew up in canada. Moved back to China last year.

Many of you ass clowns subscribe to the concept that Chinese have small dicks. Honestly that’s cool, but if you subscribe to that, then you must also subscribe to the fact that chinese have high IQs

PDD has about 14k employees. It is amongst the elite of the elite companies to work at, especially for fresh chinese college grads. China has 1.4 billion people.

Imagine a high IQ country of 1.4 billion people, now imagine 14k of the highest IQ people out of those 1.4 billion high IQ people working at a single company, and you got PDD.

###China’s 996 work culture

996 means 9am - 9pm, 6 days a week. Basically a 70-hour work week. It’s extremely toxic, but undoubtedly the most competitive work model in the world.

Imagine a company of people with average IQ of 135, all working 70 hours a week. Imagine the competitiveness of such an organization.

Temu’s tremendous growth is no surprise. Temu is the fastest growth e-commerce marketplace for a good fucking reason. Like I mentioned, it’s built by an organization with an average IQ of 135, with basically everyone no life working 70 hour weeks.

###Personal experience:

- So far in China I dated 2 girls working from PDD. One worked in HR and one worked in product. They were horribly unattractive. Why? They dunno how to use makeup, they dunno how to dress. They only know how to work. The HR girl especially, told me just how many interviews they’re doing. They’re growing FAST. Their work pace is literally incomprehensible for clueless westerners. I’d wager most US tech workers would probably have a mental breakdown if they work 1 month at PDD, because they simply can’t handle its pace and the stress.
- After moving back to china, I first started buying shit off jd.com and taobao because I haven’t heard of PDD. Then one day I started using PDD, and from that day onwards, 80% of my online purchases are from PDD. It’s simply the best shopping app in China for most items. That’s all you need to know.

The biggest counter-argument is… “But it’s a chinese company! They’re cooking the books”

- Just because 1 chinese company cooked the books, doesn’t mean every chinese company is cooking the books, dumbass.
- Chinese companies live in fear of being delisted due to the bad reputation that chinese companies have. Do you really think they’re dumb enough to cook the books when they got a target on their back? If you got a target pointed at your back, you play it safe, dumbass.
- That 1 chinese company known for cooking its books? Well, if you bought its stock at the bottom, you would have 15x’ed your money, dumbass

PDD is a long term hold for me, although I might consider selling if it hits ~$200 USD (2x my book value) in a short timeframe and look at other options.

###This is a sure thing.

###Trust me on this one.

P.S. Most of you dumbasses are too dumb to realize that China’s stock market today is like US’s stock market in the 70s. Buffett’s success cannot be replicated today in the US market, but it can be replicated in the chinese market. There are so many undervalued stocks in the Chinese stock market today due to the intense fear investors have for the Chinese stock market, both from domestic chinese investors and international. There are so many opportunities in the chinese stock market today, but most of you watch too much western propaganda and don’t have enough brain cells to think anything else except “CHINA BAD”, “CANT TRUST NO CHINESE COMPANY”, “THEY BE COOKING THE BOOKS AND SHIT YO”, “CHINESE BE COMMUNIST AND SHIT BRO LOL”",2024-12-05,-0.9619,Negative,"['PDD', 'DD', 'TFSA', 'PDD', 'TFSA', 'DD', 'PDD', 'IQ', 'IQ', 'IQ', 'PDD', 'IQ', 'IQ', 'PDD', 'HR', 'HR', 'FAST', 'US', 'PDD', 'PDD', 'PDD', 'PDD', 'PDD', 'USD', 'US', 'US', 'CHINA', 'BAD', 'CANT', 'TRUST', 'NO', 'THEY', 'BE', 'THE', 'BOOKS', 'AND', 'SHIT', 'YO', 'BE', 'AND', 'SHIT', 'BRO', 'LOL']"

Roku’s real value is in the data.,1h6yt8c,Adventurous-Date-397,2024-12-05 08:15:25,6,0.69,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h6yt8c/rokus_real_value_is_in_the_data/,"I want you to ask yourself a question:

How valuable are the things we pay attention to? 

**Half** of American households have a Roku device.

Roku is the leading streaming TV distributor in the U.S., reaching nearly 120 million people.**Roku's audience is larger than the subscribers of the six largest traditional pay-TV providers combined.** It is the #1 smart TV streaming OS in the US, Canada and Mexico.

Source: https://developer.roku.com/docs/features/features-overview.md

As of the third quarter of 2024, Roku has 85.5 million active accounts worldwide, which is the company's highest ever, a 12.8% increase from Q3 2023.

Streaming time per active user: 246.8 minutes per day in Q3 2024, a 5.8% increase from Q3 2023

As part of Roku’s privacy policy, they collect:

“Information about your activities, like the channels you install or access (including usage statistics such as what channels you access, the time you access them, and how long you spend viewing them), and information about the videos and other content you select and stream within these streaming services. If you use the Roku Media Player to view your video or photo files or listen to your music files, Roku will collect data about the files viewed within the Roku Media Player, such as codecs, and other metadata of the local files you play.”

https://docs.roku.com/published/userprivacypolicy/en/us

Why do you think they practically give away their streaming sticks? The money isn’t in their devices, it’s in the data they collect on you. 

Google’s in a similar business. They have 4.97 billion users, and their market cap is 2.14 Trillion. The valuation is 428x the amount of users.

If we applied the same multiples, that means $ROKU is worth around a 37 Billion dollar market cap, putting $ROKU at $250 a share. 

I’d venture to say it’s more around $750 a share, given the majority of Roku’s users are in the US.

Let’s see what this holds.

It has affected at least 3 different towns, with 179 people now dead, from over 300 people infected. First cases were recorded in mid-November, with cases likely stretching back to late October. Things are moving quickly. Kinshasa with 17 million people, sits 3.5 hours drive from Kwango. 

https://nypost.com/2024/12/04/us-news/a-mystery-disease-has-killed-179-mostly-teenagers-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo/

What could it be? 
Kwango was identified in a 2020 research paper as an area at-risk of a potential zoonotic spillover event (see picture). The study found that bats in the area were infected with coronaviruses with high genetic similarity to existing human coronaviruses. Notably, while recent experience has exemplified the threat of coronaviruses from Asian bat populations, several coronaviruses that now constitute common colds, likely originated in ancestral African bat populations. 

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.211664v1.full

What could we expect in coming days: The last time a substantive pandemic risk hit the market (bird flu), Moderna’s stock rose 40% in a short period of time (peaking at $166). This was despite there being no evidence of human-to-human transmission, H5N1 vaccines already available commercially from competing firms, and effective flu antivirals. Given this is unlikely to be a flu virus, Moderna will have a much more competitive edge, and we could expect to see a much stronger share price result. 

https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/moderna-stock-is-lone-omen-bird-flu-pandemic-2024-06-17/

Risk:

If this doesn’t turn out to be a pandemic risk, the downside risk is low. The news of this event only reached western media yesterday, and hasn’t materially affected prices yet. At the current price you are getting in on the ground floor. Additionally, RFK’s nomination has driven market sentiment of Moderna’s stock to just above cash, which mitigates the downside risk of negative trial readouts in coming weeks.

BULLISH ASF ON $HOOD,1h6wje1,Call-Me_CD,2024-12-05 06:26:06,33,0.67,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h6wje1/bullish_asf_on_hood/,"TL;DR: 
Robinhood’s Investor Day highlighted massive growth opportunities, including expanding crypto offerings (20 to 260 tokens), entering institutional trading, and exploring sports betting with innovative products like event contracts. The company’s profitability, $600B TAM, and focus on global expansion position it as a long-term fintech powerhouse. I’m bullish AF on $HOOD, with a $55 call expiring in 2027 and plans to buy shares monthly.
______________________________________
Post:

Good Evening my fellow WSB Degens!

I’ve attached the link to the post so you can check out Robinhood’s Investor Presentation or watch the livestream from earlier today yourself. Trust me, it’s worth a look if you want to dig into the details.

I apologize in advance if this post looks like a bag of ass. I’m posting from my phone, and Reddit is making it harder to edit this than it should be. But trust me—if it’s readable enough, you’re gonna want to stick around and read through this because there’s some serious juice here.

After watching parts of the livestream, reading through their Investor Presentation, and sprinkling in some speculation, here’s why I think you should be bullish on $HOOD for the short-term, near-term, long-term, and forever:

_____________________________________
1. Short-Term Growth Drivers

•Staking Expansion: Robinhood’s staking rollout in Europe has already onboarded $4M+ in assets, with 24% of Solana staked on the platform. A broader U.S. rollout is on the horizon and could significantly boost revenues and user engagement.
	
•Crypto Expansion: Robinhood currently supports 20 crypto tokens but has plans to scale to match Coinbase’s 260 assets. This expansion will attract more active traders and drive Robinhood’s share of the growing crypto market.

•Profitable Growth: Robinhood hit $2.4B in LTM net revenue (up 36% YoY) and $949M in adjusted EBITDA (up 96% YoY). They’re no longer just a disruptor—they’re now a profitable fintech powerhouse.

___________________________________
2. Near-Term Strategic Initiatives

•Institutional Crypto Market: Institutional trading makes up 80% of crypto volume, and Robinhood is moving into this space through partnerships and acquisitions. By offering low-cost trading, they’re positioned to capture a huge chunk of this untapped revenue.

•Robinhood Legend: Their new desktop platform, Robinhood Legend, is targeting the 50% of retail trading volume conducted on web-based platforms. This move aims to win over users who currently trade with incumbents.
	
•Global Expansion: With plans to launch brokerage services in Asia (2025) and expand crypto offerings in Europe, Robinhood is scaling up globally and positioning itself as a major player in multiple markets.

___________________________________
3. Long-Term Vision and Opportunities

•10-Year Vision: Robinhood is gunning to become the #1 platform for active traders, dominate wallet share, and establish a global financial ecosystem. The endgame? Hold all customer assets and manage every transaction.
	
•$600B TAM (Total Addressable Market):
	
•$20B+ from active traders.
	
•$180B+ from wallet share expansion via products like Robinhood Gold.
	
•$400B+ from tokenization, staking, and institutional services.
	
•Untapped Opportunities: Robinhood plans to introduce new products like mutual funds, fixed income, trust accounts, and 529 accounts, adding even more revenue streams.

___________________________________
4. Exploring Sports Betting

During the Q&A, Robinhood leadership was asked about adding sports betting. They explained that while their Event Contracts fall under federal CFTC regulations, traditional sports betting is state-regulated. However, they’re exploring the space, and here’s why this could be huge:
	
•Gen Z: Around 20-25% of Gen Z already bets on sports, and this percentage is rising.
	
•Millennials: 30-40% of Millennials are active in sports betting.
Adding sports betting could diversify Robinhood’s offerings and attract younger users, tapping into a lucrative and growing market.

___________________________________
Key Growth Catalysts

1.Crypto Leadership: Robinhood’s low-cost staking and trading features, along with its plan to expand from 20 to 260 crypto assets, position it as a leader in the fast-growing crypto market.
	
2.Diversified Revenue Streams: With nine product lines generating $100M+ annually, Robinhood is no longer dependent on just one revenue stream.
	
3.Customer Value: Robinhood has delivered $34B+ in value to customers through lower fees, better yields, and innovative features.

__________________________________
Why Robinhood Stands Out

•Low-Cost Leadership: Robinhood continues to offer industry-leading low fees across equities, options, and crypto, making it the go-to platform for cost-conscious traders.
	
•Technological Innovation: Tools like Robinhood Legend and AI-driven products keep the company ahead of its fintech peers.
	
•Expanding Global Reach: Expansion into Asia and Europe cements Robinhood’s position as a global financial leader.


___________________________________
Investment Thesis:

Robinhood’s combination of profitability, innovation, and expansion into untapped markets makes it a standout growth stock. With plans to enter institutional trading, expand crypto services (scaling from 20 to 260 tokens), and explore sports betting, the company is diversifying its revenue streams and positioning itself for sustained long-term success.

___________________________________
A Unique Path to Dominance:

Robinhood stands to benefit significantly from the likely deregulatory policies of a Trump administration, which historically prioritizes free-market policies and reduces financial regulations. This could streamline approvals for new products like staking and tokenization while easing restrictions on crypto and trading practices. Additionally, deregulation might open the door for Robinhood to aggressively expand into areas like sports betting, enhancing its product pipeline and competitive edge.

_______________________________
Conclusion: Robinhood isn’t just a disruptor—it’s a company with the vision and roadmap to dominate the financial markets. For those looking for a high-growth fintech stock with global ambitions, $HOOD is a play worth watching.

Considering that most of us degenerates use Robinhood because we already know how beast this platform is, I’m surprised I have not seen a lot of posts on it. With these numbers, this beast of a company deserves way more attention.

_________________________________
My Position:

Currently, I’ve got (1) HOOD $55 Call 1/15/27 because I’m broke asf right now, but I plan to buy shares monthly until the expiration date of the contract. Considering how much potential this stock has, I might actually go ahead and execute the contract.

I’ve personally gone through Robinhood’s 210-slide Investor Day presentation, read other takes on X, and reviewed articles from SeekingAlpha and Barron’s in regards to the Investor Day news. I also caught the last 40 minutes of the livestream where they mentioned sports betting. The analysis and opinions here are mine—ChatGPT was just used to make the post easier to read, and that’s it.

They have market cap of 3.2 Billion. What do they do?

MDA Space is a technology and services company that provides advanced solutions to the global space industry:

* **Geointelligence**: Uses satellite data and imagery for climate change monitoring, national security, and global commerce
* **Robotics & Space Operations**: Provides autonomous robotics and vision sensors for space exploration
* **Satellite Systems**: Provides spacecraft and systems for space-based services, including broadband internet connectivity 

MDA Space has a history of firsts and over 450 missions. They have been providing operational readiness support for the International Space Station's (ISS) Mobile Servicing System since 2001. They are also known for delivering large-scale robotic systems, such as Canadarm2.

And this excerpt from a post by user manolo44 sure is bullish:

""Their earnings report was stellar: growth of 38% yoy, it is actually **PROFITABLE** \- none of the other space companies are profitable - profitability with adjusted EBITDA of $55.5 million, up 30% YoY, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%, net income up 60% yoy, and net debt adjusted EBITDA ratio of just 0.8x (so zero risk of dilution). However, post earnings the stock was mostly flat. Why? Their reported backlog was unchanged from previous quarter report (backlog is 4.6B btw).

But if any of you folks had bothered to tune in to the call, you would have heard the CEO say that it is a fact that by year end they will be **definitely be signing a new contract worth 750M** – of these, only 300M is recorded in backlog – a**n additional $450M is going to be added** upon finalization and t**his will happen by year’s end.** They in fact stated during the Q&A that they are confident they will be finishing 2024 with $5B backlog. They also said MDA’s satellite systems division alone has a $**15B+ pipeline** of potential projects, thanks to its Aurora-class satellites tailored for low Earth orbit  constellations.

 MDA is building a new 185,000 sq. ft. facility in Quebec, **capable of producing two satellites per day** starting in late 2025.""

And then I heard this:

MDA Space, which is a sleeping giant merely because it trades in the Toronto Stock Exchange rather than US, is exploring listing in the US, according to comments by its CEO;

“Management suggested that it continues to explore a potential dual stock listing in the U.S.""

Now I am not sure how a dual listing will effect my 500 MDALF shares but if I had to guess I would say it will be a good thing.

There have been posts on Reddit about how bad of a company they are to their employees, but just like Yelp you usually only hear about the bad apples, not the good ones, so I take that with a grain of salt. This article that came out today today says they are ""one of Toronto's greatest employers""

# Hypothesis

Given that Ernie Garcia II owns DriveTime, Bridgecrest, and SilverRock and remains Carvana's controlling shareholder, Carvana could have been given beneficial contract terms that improved its metrics and, consequently, its market price.

Take a look at these paragraphs from their [2023 Annual Report (page 20)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1690820/000169082024000093/cvna-20231231.htm):

>""We were incubated by and may benefit from our relationship and a series of **arrangements with DriveTime not always negotiated at arm’s length**, as DriveTime is controlled by our controlling shareholder who is also the father of our chief executive officer. (...)

>DriveTime built certain of our inspection and reconditioning centers (""IRCs"") in Georgia, New Jersey, and Texas and is now our landlord at some such sites. Verde Investments, Inc. (""Verde""), an affiliate of DriveTime, formerly leased to us our Arizona IRC and sold it to us in 2020. We have also historically leased certain of our hubs from DriveTime. (...)

>Consequently, certain of **our historical costs and expansion activities may not accurately reflect our future costs and expansion** to the extent that DriveTime no longer provides us with such services or refuses to continue doing so at currently contracted-for prices.""

>""We continue to periodically engage DriveTime, its affiliates, and other entities controlled by our controlling shareholder to provide us with certain services, including the administration of certain VSCs and other related products sold to our customers. (...)

>Additionally, **DriveTime has in the past and may in the future purchase or sell certain vehicles or automotive finance receivables from or to us**. However, there can be no assurance that they will do so on the same or similar terms, or at all. As a result, our historical results may not be reflected in our future results.

>Before and after we sell automotive finance receivables originated by us, **DriveTime performs ongoing servicing and collections**. If DriveTime is unwilling to enter into servicing arrangements for our future automotive finance receivable transactions on terms or at prices consistent with their historical prices or at all, our revenues derived from the sale of those receivables may decline as a result. (...)""

By **""not always negotiated at arm’s length""**, it implies they might be receiving favorable benefits in terms of assets, revenue, and expenses. This raises the possibility that their reports may not fairly represent their future costs and expansion, as some aspects could be currently ""hidden"" under the financial and operational support from DriveTime.

According to their Q3 2024 reporting, \~15% of their L9M operating income comes from related parties. ([Q3 Report](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-shareholder-letter-q3-2024.pdf))

# ELI5:

1. Carvana could be unintentionally overstating revenues and understating future expenses through its favorable agreements with DriveTime;
2. Carvana share price increases based on its *""all-time best""* metrics;
3. Ernie Garcia II - Carvana's controlling shareholder and DriveTime's owner - sells $1.4 billion in stock;
4. At some point, DriveTime and its affiliates may change or dismiss the arrangements, and Carvana's actual revenue, capex, and opex numbers would show up.

# ""Other Gross Profit Per Unit - GPU""

Carvana mentioned their ""Total gross profit per unit (""GPU"") was $7,427."" on their [Q3 2024 report](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-shareholder-letter-q3-2024.pdf).

They arrive at this figure by adding together ""Retail GPU"", ""Wholesale GPU"", and ""Other GPU"". I find this calculation quite suspicious tbh but I want to focus on **""Other GPU""** instead, which was $3,000. 

Going back to the [2023 Annual Report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1690820/000169082024000093/cvna-20231231.htm):

>""Other sales and revenues, which primarily includes gains on the sales of finance receivables we originate and sales commissions on ancillary products such as VSCs, GAP waiver coverage, and auto insurance, totaled $753 million and $741 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (...) **Other sales and revenues are 100% gross margin products for which gross profit equals revenue**."" (...)

>""We generate other sales and revenues primarily through the sales of loans we originate and sell in securitization transactions or to financing partners, reported net of a reserve for expected repurchases, commissions we receive on VSCs, sales of GAP waiver coverage, and commissions and Root Warrants we receive on sales of auto insurance"" (...)

>""In 2016, we entered into a master dealer agreement with DriveTime, pursuant to which **we receive a commission for selling VSCs that DriveTime administers**. The commission revenue we recognize on VSCs depends on the number of retail units we sell, the conversion rate of VSCs on these sales, commission rates we receive, VSC early cancellation frequency and product features. The GAP waiver coverage revenue we recognize depends on the number of retail units we sell, the number of customers that choose to finance their purchases with us, the frequency of GAP waiver coverage early cancellation, and the conversion rate of GAP waiver coverage on those sales."" (...)

>""**DriveTime purchases wholesale vehicles from, and sells wholesale vehicles to, both the Company and unrelated third parties** through both competitive online auctions that are managed by unrelated third parties and the Company's wholesale marketplace platform. Additionally, beginning in September 2023, **the Company provided DriveTime with reconditioning services through its wholesale marketplace platform. The Company recognized $19 million, $32 million, and $54 million of wholesale sales and revenues from DriveTime** during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.""

Carvana engages in transactions with DriveTime **'not always at arm’s length,'** and DriveTime accounts for a relevant portion of Carvana's revenue and gross profit. This can be a problem.

Consider also a **hypothetical** scenario:

Imagine a vehicle with a market price of $10,000. Carvana buys it from a customer for $10,000 and then sells it to DriveTime for $11,000. DriveTime reconditions the vehicle and sells it back to Carvana at a wholesale price of $8,000. Carvana then sells it to a customer for $10,500.

* Carvana gross profit: $3,500
* DriveTime gross profit: -$3,000 (excl. costs)

This wouldn't be sustainable unless: 1. you own and control both companies, 2. one of them is publicly traded and sensitive to profitability metrics, and 3. you have the ability to sell shares whenever needed.

Please I'm not suggesting this happens at Carvana, but given their *not always at arm's length arrangements* and the lack of detailed data, this scenario remains a possibility. We rely on the work of their auditors to ensure that this is not the case.

# How to validate that hypothesis?

We would need to investigate the benefits Carvana receives, verify any discrepancies from reality, consider internal transactions, and calculate how these might affect the GPU and other metrics. Unfortunately, SEC reports don't offer enough info for that.

# SG&A Expenses

On a side note, I found it impressive how they've managed to grow retail units sold and expand market hubs without increasing their SG&A expenses over the quarters.

They expanded from \~120,000 retail and wholesale vehicles sold in Q3 2023 to +160,000 within 12 months, keeping their market occupancy and logistics costs flat. This should be featured as a case study by Harvard Business Review.

Quick Note: Under ""definitional differences to consider"" on [this document from Q4 2023](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-shareholder-letter-q4-2023.pdf), ""Limited Warranty Expenses"" and ""Outbound Logistics Expenses"" are included in SG&A expense rather than COGS. Given that, I'd have expected SG&A to increase as a result of selling +35% more vehicles.

The company has a solid track record of profitability, strong revenue growth, and a valuation that looks too low to ignore. 

# Financial Highlights

* **12 mo Revenue**: $6.11B
* **Net Income**: $487.2M
* **12 mo EPS**: $6.45 pretty solid for a retailer in this space
* **Valuation**: P/E ratio is 7.44. For comparison, Dick’s Sporting Goods is 14.97 and they sell the same stuff
* **FCF**: $218M up from $167M last quarter

# Why ASO Stands Out

1. Academy opened 16 new stores in 2024 with 1/3 of those in Q4 alone. Goal by 2027 is to open between 160-180 new stores.
2. Partnering with DoorDash for same day delivery so you can get your Wendy's frosty and a new baseball glove in the same order.
3. Academy is known more for its winter and spring sports. Think hunting, fishing, baseball, basketball and those seasons are here and around the corner. And yes they carry all the same items that Dick's does often for more of a deal (Yeti, Nike, Carhartt, Shimano, Brooks, Rawlings, UnderAmour, etc).
4. ASO consistently generates strong earnings, but the market hasn’t caught up yet imo. The P/E ratio is significantly lower than the industry average, making it a potential value play.
5. The **12/10 earnings report** could provide the boost this stock needs, especially if they beat expectations or provide strong holiday guidance. Plus, the holiday season itself is a crucial time for ASO, and strong Q4 sales could drive further upside. 
6. Analysts are on board with an average price target of $63.40. That’s about a 30% upside from where it’s trading now, suggesting there’s room to grow with upper end being $85.
7. Currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, maybe signaling some hesitation in the market but if it breaks through those levels after earnings, it might attract more buyers.
8. At 62.99 RSI, it’s not quite overbought but heading in that direction - another sign that buyers are starting to show some interest.

**TLDR**

Academy Sports is a profitable, undervalued company with a big quarter ahead into the holiday/ spring sports season.

The simple math behind Microstrategy and the infinite money glitch.,1h6qkvb,JollyPicklePants1969,2024-12-05 02:11:34,0,0.3,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h6qkvb/the_simple_math_behind_microstrategy_and_the/,"Assumption: Bitcoin $13m price in 2045.  

This is Michael Saylor's bullish bitcoin thesis.  There is a good amount of reasoning and data behind this forecast.  It may or may not happen.  The risk of any investment in MSTR stock is based on this prediction.  If Bitcoin fails to appreciate, the MSTR bull thesis is busted.

MSTR current bitcoin holdings: 401,100

Current bitcoin price: 96,000

Balance sheet: 77b

2045 bitcoin price: 13,000,000

2045 balance sheet (assuming zero additional bitcoin acquisition): $5.2t

Assuming MSTR's premium to NAV falls to 1 over time, the result is a 23% CAGR from now until 2045 if the bull thesis holds true. This is a HUGE long term return in the stock market.  An investor takes on the risk of bitcoin not appreciating to 13m in exchange for high potential returns.  

An individual investor could do even better by just buying bitcoin, but for an institutional investor who is tasked with building an equity portfolio, this is a simple thesis with a clear long term trajectory that will drastically outperform the market if bitcoin performs as expected.

Let's take this further...

What if the MSTR stock price doubles tomorrow?  In that case, the long term CAGR over the next 20 years ONLY falls to 19%.  This is still a great bet for an equity manager.

But remember! This is assuming MSTR does not engage in any more accretive dillution and BTC per share remains constant.  If they do continue to accrue bitcoin, BTC per share goes up, and returns along with it.  

So there is a case for having a present day premium to NAV based on MSTR equity returns outperforming the general equity market. At the same time, that NAV premium allows additional value to accrue to MSTR, which justifies further NAV premium, and so on.

This is all based on the simple fact that MSTR does not have to outperform bitcoin to be a good equity investment.  It simply has to have a reasonable chance of outperforming the equity markets.  This justifies a premium to NAV, which allows the machine to keep working.

Presto: Infinite money glitch until bitcoin collapses in upon itself.

NVIDIA's share price surge and the outlook for the AI arithmetic market: bubble risk and rational layout of industry giants ’,1h6ph5g,conbuite,2024-12-05 01:26:50,0,0.43,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h6ph5g/nvidias_share_price_surge_and_the_outlook_for_the/,"https://preview.redd.it/8ei98fya0w4e1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbc0a93b262593e8ea76c7e7efbfacacac3502b5

As NVIDIA's share price has risen sharply in the short term, many have begun to wonder if the industry is facing a turning point or if there is a bubble. From the perspective of the industry giants, GPUs, as representatives of A1 arithmetic chips, are currently far from meeting demand. We can assume that AI applications are still only in their infancy, and there has not yet been a particularly prominent Al burst application in the world.

Analyse the results:

The AI market is still at an early stage: AI applications, despite explosive growth in recent years, are still at an early stage. The arithmetic power required for current AI applications (e.g., big language modelling, autonomous driving, robotics, etc.), especially GPUs, is still in the pre-burst stage. The growth of Tesla and the robotics industry, for example, predicts that billions of robots will be needed in the future for arithmetic support. This means that there is a huge potential for growth in AI arithmetic demand over the next few years, especially in inferential computing.



GPUs as core hardware for AI: GPUs play a key role in AI inference computing, especially in tasks that require high parallel processing power (e.g., deep learning inference, autonomous driving, robot control, etc.). Although there are already many GPU products on the market, overall, the demand for AI computing power is still in a state of oversupply, and the size of the AI computing power market is likely to continue to expand, especially in the ‘reasoning’ segment of the demand for this segment is the area of high computation, especially in the field of automated driving, cloud computing and so on.



Personal view: NVIDIA's leadership in the GPU space is well recognised, but many are beginning to worry about an industry bubble due to the short-term surge in its share price.

NVIDIA's dominant position: Currently, NVIDIA is the almost unrivalled leader in the field of AI hardware (especially GPUs), and its products are widely used in AI training and reasoning calculations, especially playing a central role in large-scale data centres and cloud services. NVIDIA's rising share price reflects investors' optimistic expectations about the potential of the AI market.



Bubble Risk: As NVIDIA's share price has surged, the market has become sceptical about whether it is overvalued. NVIDIA's high valuation could lead to the formation of a bubble, especially if its products and technologies are not sufficiently digested by the market. While the AI industry is promising, the market is volatile in the short term and the rise of competitors (e.g. AMD) could change the market landscape. Therefore, investors and industry observers need to be wary of market overheating and short-term speculation.



Core view: US tech giants (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook) are supportive of NVIDIA's technology, but they will also support NVIDIA's competitors, such as AMD, in order to avoid the arithmetic market being monopolised by one company and to ensure the sustainable development of the industry.



Analyse the results:

Rational rather than short-term profit-driven: the behaviour of these tech giants suggests that they are not simply pursuing short-term profit when purchasing AI arithmetic, but are planning the security and sustainability of their own development in the long term. By supporting competitors such as AMD, these companies avoid the risk of the market becoming too dependent on NVIDIA alone, ensuring diversity in market competition and technological innovation. This kind of rational decision-making is crucial to the healthy development of the AI hardware market.



If NVIDIA dominates the AI arithmetic market without competitive pressure, it could lead to overpricing, affecting the interests of other tech giants. As a result, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon prefer to ensure diversity and healthy competition in the AI arithmetic market by supporting competitors such as AMD.



In summary: future outlook and risks

Huge potential for AI arithmetic: The demand for AI arithmetic is far from reaching its ceiling, especially in the area of inferential computing, and the market demand for GPUs will continue to grow as robotics and autonomous driving technologies evolve. The adoption of AI technologies will generate even more demand for arithmetic power in the coming decades, especially in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving.



NVIDIA's dominance and risks: While NVIDIA's dominance in the AI hardware space cannot be ignored, the sharp rise in its share price and high market valuation have raised concerns about the existence of a bubble. Future technological competition, especially the rise of competitors such as AMD, may affect NVIDIA's market share.



Long-term layout of industry giants: U.S. tech giants are very rational when investing in AI arithmetic, they will not simply pursue short-term benefits, but pay more attention to the diversity of the arithmetic market and the sustainability of the technology, to ensure that they can be invincible in the competition in the coming years.

The AI arithmetic market is full of great potential, but is still in the early stages of development. While NVIDIA occupies a leading position in the AI hardware market, its high valuation and share price volatility also make the risk of a bubble

ZIM at a discount price,1h6npyy,Cockballzz,2024-12-05 00:16:44,8,0.63,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h6npyy/zim_at_a_discount_price/,"ZIM Integrated Shipping Services had a strong Q3 earnings release in November beating the expectations. They raised their 2024 full year guidance of 300M and it's very likely they will give another good dividend for the upcoming quarter.

After the earnings release on Nov 20 the price shoot up to $30 and came back down in the oversold territory of $19, the P/E of the company is fairly low right now.

One of the reasons about that recent drop in price is because it's a dividend stock and they will pay a juicy $3.65 per share on Dec 9 which represents 16.5% on the last day (Nov 29) before trading ex-dividend (Dec 2).

The stock is currently consolidating and staying in the range of $18 to $21 until the dividend is received (Dec 9) and starting next week I'm expexting to stock price to move back up again.

The company added 42 new ships in the past 3 years and they are expecting 4 more ships by the end of 2024. More ships shoud bring more revenues if no outside factors disturb their activities and the container price stays in the same range.

That's my quick thesis on this stock and if you dig deeper I think you should feel comfortable in putting money on this play. Source as always : Trust me bro!

TL:DR ... I expect ZIM to go up in the range of $24.5 / $26.5 within the next 2 months. You can play safe and buy shares of try calls for Feb 21 or later.

Positions 120k :
5500 shares @ $22.12 (pre-dividend)
55CC Dec 6 strike $21.16
Waiting for my dividend on Dec 9 5500 x $3.65 = 20k

At first glance, DocuSign's eSignature services may seem pretty boring. But after a closer look, I think they could really disrupt the way companies manage their legal stuff. Let's face it, the traditional contract signing process is a pain. Even small businesses deal with a mountain of contracts-both with their customers and as customers themselves - and it's far too easy to get lost in the paperwork.

DocuSign steps in with generative AI that makes contracts easier to understand by cutting through all the legal stuff. They simplify the content so one can actually understand what a contract says without a law degree. Think about how much companies spend on their legal departments. If Docusign can help streamline that process, it could save companies a lot of money. The integration of AI also enables advanced analytics, risk assessments and compliance checks, further enhancing the platform's utility.

You know those boring jobs in warehouses? Yeah, $SYM is here to make sure robots do them instead. They're automating supply chains for **big-name whales** like Walmart and Target. Picture a warehouse full of little robotic autists zipping around, stacking boxes, and making Jeff Bezos sweat. Now imagine that happening **everywhere**. That's $SYM's future.

Why Invest you ask? Well, three main reasons.

1. Nobody, and I mean nobody on this sub is talking about it. **Its AI, its robotics**, its what we love, it's sexy and not a single post has been created about them. I am early, you are early, we are all early. Go on, search the subreddit, see if you can find anything recently.
2. Now, here’s where it gets spicy. You know a stock has potential when it’s already had **accounting errors** and **TWO tax fraud issues**. Classic. That’s the kind of chaos we love. If you think this will stop them, you must be new here. It’s not fraud; it’s *creative bookkeeping.* If you’re worried about numbers not adding up, congrats, you’re not WSB material. The best plays are the sketchiest ones. I mean, they got caught **twice**, but they’re still here. That means one thing: **they’re resilient.** This is like a phoenix rising from a pile of shredded tax forms
3. The financials are solid, according to my accounting roommate who is no longer an accountant. **54% YoY** revenue growth. **Almost profitable**. Strong customer base and over 10 billion in orders for the future. the best part? **Softbank backed**. Have I said enough?

**Closing argument**

Despite some small human errors within the financial department and getting a few numbers wrong, the product is there, the demand for it is there. And, need I not say one more goddamn time, its robotics and AI. **The revenue keeps growing and the comapny is only valued at $20B with $1.8B of revenue a year.** Its the opportunity to save your marriage, your house, and your kids. They dropped 40% last week cuz of an 'error', I can't see it not making back 20% of that in the next 3-6 months. You are early.

That by itself is a moat.""* **and** *""In Reddit's case, the core strength is that basically everyone else gave up on the ""classic internet"" of true user forums and all the richness that comes with that. The fact that everyone now appends ""reddit"" to their search queries means that Reddit just accidentally ate search, while AI search is still unreliable.""*

While other platforms chased AI chatbots, Reddit doubled down on being the place for real human knowledge - **and they are now getting paid for this by -all- ML/AI providers to train their models in an ongoing way.** Why should it stop? Imagine if Google stopped indexing the web in 2021, how useful would it be?

# Congratulations, You Had Alpha and (Maybe) Acted Like a Beta

Alpha, aka you can beat the market due to ""not yet fully priced in"". For once in your life, you actually had insider information and a headstart. You've been using this platform daily for years, watching it grow, survive blackouts and rebellions, seeing the engagement firsthand. Everyone said at one point ""that is enough, I'm leaving"", and yet here we are.

Look at the institutional ownership story (based on Finviz data)

* Pinterest: 77%
* Snap: 51%
* Reddit: 39%, and growing crazy (+122% increase, mostly since the Q3 number revelation)

Translation: Those Chad analysts who just ""discovered"" Reddit still have % of buying to do just to match other social platforms. The same guys writing [$180 price targets](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/reddit-price-target-raised-180-120-loop-capital) are probably reading this post right now for their next investment thesis, updating their PowerPoints about ""untapped market potential"" and ""engagement metrics"" that you've been seeing firsthand for years.

They're figuring out that:

1. The platform has better margins than Google (90%) - thanks to mostly text-based content
2. Growing faster than Pinterest or Snap ever did - thanks to Google-vouch and ML localization
3. With the latest AI-craze, their non-stop, text-base, perfectly crawlable human content can be heavily licensed ($)

For once, you were early to something. You had the inside track. And you're letting Patagonia-vested-dudes steal your lunch money while he expense-accounts his at Sweetgreen.

# The Path to $100B You Should Have Seen Coming

Pinterest peaked at $50B showing wedding cakes. Twitter sold for $44B before becoming whatever it is now. Reddit at $26B:

* Actually profitable
* Better margins than both combined
* Still only using 1/3 to 1/2 of potential ad space compred to others
* Machine learning translation rolling out to 30+ countries (tests in France showed +50% growth)
* The only major platform still growing users at 47% YoY
* See chart below: **relative** Google Trend (per platform) shows RDDT is more trending than ever before

[Again, RELATIVE growth of Google Trends. But look at that beautiful, solid, robust orange growth.](https://preview.redd.it/3ezc3gvh4t4e1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a0a784c76756a8ba2c9067de459a2e0665ead30)

# Position & The Bottom Line

I currently own 4000 shares at 98.50 EUR because I finally decided to invest in the platform I waste most of my life on. I initially had only 100 pre-Q3 numbers, to test the waters. I also sold 200 at \~147 EUR two weeks ago for some sweet mini-profits.

And current position in total with 160k unrealized gains as of now.

You're reading this on Reddit right now. Probably about to check the comments to see if I'm full of shit, then go back looking to find ""deep value plays"" in Malaysian basket weaving companies. Meanwhile the RDDT flywheel is spinning faster and faster.

So, when you get asked at Thanksgiving 2026 why you didn't invest in the site you spent 4-8 hours a day on, what's your excuse going to be?

# TL;DR

RDDT is now profitable, growing 47% YoY with 90% margins, institutions are loading up fast, and you're reading this on their platform right now, thinking you missed the boat at $150 - newsflash: you didn't (yet).

Teladoc Health (TDOC): Why It’s Poised for a Comeback,1h65vsv,QuantumMajestic,2024-12-04 08:22:25,0,0.49,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h65vsv/teladoc_health_tdoc_why_its_poised_for_a_comeback/,"#

Hello fellow degenerates,

Let’s talk about Teladoc (TDOC). If you’ve been following, you know it’s been through the fire and the flames. Once a darling of the telehealth boom, it’s now more like the kid who got benched after fucking up the big game. But I believe the tide is about to turn. Here’s my DD on why Teladoc might just be gearing up for a glorious comeback.&#x20;

---

## 1. **Current Stock Snapshot: The Lay of the Land**

Teladoc’s stock has seen better days, but as of now:

- **Stock Price:** \$10.95 (down slightly today).
- **52-Week Range:** From scraping the barrel at \$9.50 to peaking around \$30.
- **Market Cap:** Roughly \$1.8 billion.

This might look like a crash and burn to some, but I see opportunity at a discount.

---

## 2. **Leadership Overhaul: A Fresh Start**

In June 2024, Teladoc made a bold move by appointing **Chuck Divita** as CEO. For context, Divita’s background includes:

- Leadership roles in companies like **Humana**, where he focused on growth and operational efficiency.
- A track record of successfully restructuring struggling business units.

Divita’s focus on cost-cutting and streamlining operations has already started to show results in the company’s latest reporting and the best is yet to come.

---

## 3. **Financial Performance: Clearing the Decks**

Let’s address the elephant in the room: Teladoc’s financials. Here’s what we know from Q2 2024:

- **Goodwill Impairment:** They took a \$790 million write-down on BetterHelp, their mental health arm, which has a dogshit reputation, especially after their data privacy scandal. Believe it or not, people don’t want their deepest secrets and personal data sold to third parties. Whodathunkit?
- **Net Loss:** \$838 million (yikes, but let’s look closer).
- **Revenue:** \$650 million (up 5% YOY).

### Why This Isn’t All Bad News:

- The goodwill impairment is an accounting adjustment. It’s painful now, but it clears the books for future growth.
- BetterHelp’s revenue decline is a reflection of tightened marketing spend, which aligns with the new CEO’s cost-cutting strategy.
- TDOC has had a steady upward trend in revenue growth YOY. A good sign of internal management.

---

## 4. **Market Position: Still a Leader**

Teladoc remains a dominant player in telehealth, with:

- 80+ million members.
- Partnerships with major insurers like UnitedHealthcare and CVS Health.
- A robust tech platform that integrates telehealth, mental health, and chronic condition management.

### Competitors:

Teladoc’s main rivals are Amwell and MDLIVE, but neither has the same level of services, and also Amwell is dogshit. Teladoc’s ecosystem approach makes it stand out, especially as big employers and insurers need seamless integrated solutions.

---

## 5. **Industry Outlook: Telehealth Is Here to Stay**

The pandemic normalized virtual care, but the trend isn’t going anywhere. Key stats:

- **Market Growth:** The global telehealth market is projected to reach \$560 billion by 2030 (CAGR of 24%).
- **Adoption Rates:** 40% of patients now prefer telehealth for routine care.
- **Regulatory Tailwinds:** The U.S. government has extended telehealth reimbursement policies through 2025.

Teladoc is uniquely positioned to capture this growth, thanks to its first-mover advantage and established brand.

---

## 6. **Valuation: A Bargain Basement Buy?**

At its current price, Teladoc trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.5x. For comparison:

- **Amwell:** 2.3x P/S.
- **Healthcare Sector Average:** 4.0x P/S.

This signals Teladoc is significantly undervalued relative to peers, especially given its revenue growth.

---

## 7. **Catalysts: What Could Drive a Comeback?**

- **Profitability Goals:** Teladoc aims to achieve positive EBITDA by mid-2025.
- **Product Expansion:** Launching AI-powered tools for personalized care.
- **Potential Acquisition Target:** At its current valuation, TDOC could attract interest from larger healthcare players.

---

## 8. **Risks: No Rose-Colored Glasses**

- **Competition:** Amazon is in this space. Relentless as fuck as always.
- **Marketing Spend:** Scaling back on ads could slow growth in the short term but is smart for a branding reboot.
- **Macroeconomic Factors:** Higher interest rates make growth companies less attractive to some investors.

---

## 9. **Conclusion: Why I’m Bullish**

Teladoc is a classic turnaround story. Yes, it’s been beaten down, but the fundamentals—leadership changes, cost-cutting, and a growing market—suggest a brighter future. At its current valuation, the risk-reward ratio looks attractive.

Do I want to be convinced otherwise? Fucking no so leave me alone bc I’m sensitive.

---

### TL;DR

- New leadership and strategic reset.
- Strong market position in a growing industry.
- Valuation suggests upside potential.
- Risks exist, but the reward looks worth it.

SMCI - value or trap?,1h638bi,IronMick777,2024-12-04 06:13:09,109,0.86,147,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h638bi/smci_value_or_trap/,"I have seen many post about SMCI and highlighting its potential undervalued qualities. Many see it *growing* to $160 a share, but in a crowd of bulls I will be one of the bears on the company. 

Whenever one wants to get a feel for what the priorities of a company are one should look no further than how executives are rewarded. CEO Charles Liang went from a salary + options package prior to 2021 to a $1.00 salary & pure options/RSU package in March of 2021 when the **2021 CEO Performance Package** was passed. Interesting timing given the boom in the AI markets. Mr. Liang cannot have his salary or other cash  comp adjusted until June 30th, 2026.

One of the KPI's was based around none other than share price appreciation. The package was awarded and set at a share price of $34.08 and the goals were broken into five tranches with the highest being $120 a share and all this needed to be hit by September 30th, 2026. This would have been a CAGR of 25% over ~5.5 years but lucky for SMCI shareholders this was achieved in ~2.2 years for a 75% CAGR. 

In November 2023 the compensation package was adjusted with the approval of the **2023 CEO Compensation Package** where SMCI was again lucky enough to achieve almost all goals on share price appreciation on these new tranches too. 

Their CFO had no KPI's around the company's health. Nothing regarding leverage ratios, operating income, cash flow generation, but three KPI's that were 1) share price appreciation (2X weighted), long-term investor increase (2X weighted), and an individual performance measured by Mr. Liang. The CFO being rewarded heavily on share price appreciation and attractive investing should be a red flag. And while the CFO achieved these goals in such a short time, he has now been rewarded with losing his job. One must ask why?

Another target is around revenue growth and while any company should be focused on revenue, the above KPI's highlight a culture that is focused on driving share price appreciation before all else. There is an active whistleblower lawsuit stating SMCI improperly recognized revenue and just today that same whistleblower doubled down on such claims. 

December 5th, 2023 SMCI made a public offering of 2,415,805 shares, then they went and issued convertible notes in February 2024, then on March 22nd, 2024 they went and issued another round of equity for 2,000,000 shares. All of this equity at a time when executives are rewarded for share price gains.

The Ablecom/Compuware relationship has been called out and I think it should have more attention. There is a lot of PO movement between these companies that are all owned by relatives. These two companies also handle design work, tool builds, and various other things; do we know where all the debt lies and perhaps CAPEX is understated as it's absorbed elsewhere? Impossible to say either way given we can't get public financials for these other organizations. No comment from SMCI leaves investors left to speculate. 

Now we get to the recent news of EY resigning. I have seen some estimates that EY was walking from multiple million dollar deal in being the auditor for SMCI, what did they see? Given the trouble EY has had over the past few years with a failed split and SEC fines, walking away from a potential AI darling account seems very difficult to understand. In the 8-K statement filed by SMCI, EY was quoted as ***""we are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.”***, which is no light statement. Yet, an internal investigation by SMCI finds nothing that aligned with what EY found? No discrepancy at all? This investigation by SMCI was led by someone who is now a board member, but of course Mr. Market rallies on the news of ""no fault"" but the pieces do not fit.

The recent cancellations of two bank facilities should also raise red flags. It is clear if you read the terms that SMCI was in violation of debt covenants and would have been in default, but these terminations now constrict liquidity. SMCI has stated they will possibly need these lending facilities to fund inventory as they see growth, but because of these filings delays and auditor resignations they cancelled them. I am not seeing many talk about the future growth constraints from this move. It also highlights there may be more here because why not work with the banks? Unless of course you have no intention of filing your 10-K/Q anytime soon or there is true risks on what BDO finds. 

While the above may indeed be nothing, I am having a hard time reading the recent events as bullish. While a self audit is good show and will likely prevent a delisting, the delayed 10-K/Q gives investors no insight into where the company stands. It is possible BDO will begin their audit and find gaps the same as EY. The equity offerings at a time when executives are rewarded for share price appreciation also is a red flag from an investor POV as your dilution is funding direct reward. The MOAT for SMCI is not as strong as many state and the margins are not either. 

While this may be value in many investors eyes, there is some big risks here that I see ignored because stoinks only go up.

However, I have concerns about whether the brand can maintain its popularity, especially if trends shift or kids gravitate toward something new. Competition from cheaper alternatives and the long lifespan of Crocs for adults, which may reduce repeat purchases, could pose challenges over time.


	1.	Low Valuation Multiples: Crocs is currently trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 8.06, significantly lower than the average P/E ratio in the consumer discretionary sector. Additionally, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.62 and price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) ratio of 6.90 suggest the stock is priced attractively relative to its revenue and cash flow generation.

	2.	Strong Margins and Cash Flow: The company boasts healthy margins, with gross margins at 58.15% and an operating margin of 26.16%. Its free cash flow has grown steadily, reaching $940 million in the trailing twelve months, with a free cash flow yield of 14.49%

	3.	Revenue Growth and Market Position: Crocs has shown consistent revenue growth, with a 3.17% year-over-year increase for 2024. It also maintains a strong position in the casual footwear market, bolstered by a popular product lineup and strategic acquisitions.

	4.	Debt Management: While its debt-to-equity ratio is on the higher side at 1.03, it has significantly reduced its leverage compared to previous years, improving its overall financial health.

People have asked me about this trade for a while now, so here are my thoughts.

I give this a buy rating for the earnings call.

Here is why.

The daily, weekly, and monthly charts are showing undervalued with positive upside as indicated by the Bollinger bands.


The MACD is indicating a buy crossover at the end of a long red period.

Implied volatility seems to say there will be a +-13.5% move.

Previous earnings look good, not too worried about anything in the news.

Spy is red today and is generally pulling other stocks, down, but GTLB is pushing back.

My expectation is that we buy now, hold through earnings because this is the perfect setup for that discount pricing.

SPY recovers in a day or two and trends up giving the market a boost. When earnings come, it will catapult. The charts say it is going up, spy will boost that. If it goes down, spy will slow it a little, but I would expect a 3m period of holding to get out at the current price if it drops by 13%.

So, there we have it, a perfect setup, with market boosting, and earnings catalyst ready to push up.

My anticipated price target is $71.

Are investors ready for a new “super cycle”?**

  
**Monday, $ Apple (AAPL.US)$ closed up 0.95%, shares rose to $ 239.59, hitting a new record high, the total market capitalization exceeded 3.62 trillion U.S. dollars, regaining the first global market value throne, compared with the second place of the NVIDIA has been higher than 250 billion U.S. dollars.

It is worth noting that since April this year, Apple's share price ushered in a sustained rise, has risen more than 45% over the closing low point on April 19 this year. The strong performance of Apple's stock price not only reflects the company's growth momentum, but also shows investors' confidence in its future development. What are the driving factors behind this upward trend?

  
Outstanding earnings performance. In the fourth fiscal quarter, when the new generation of iPhones just hit the market, the revenue of Apple's core product, iPhone, returned to positive growth, and the growth momentum exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driving the company's total revenue to a record high for the same period. The solid financial situation undoubtedly provides investors with confidence.

Technology innovation and AI strategic layout. While the core products are changing, Apple is also launching new products, from Apple Watch to smart home products, to meet the diversified needs of consumers. In addition, Apple's continued expansion in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence has laid the foundation for its future growth with the gradual release of Apple's AI capabilities.

Global market expansion. Apple's sales revenue in Europe, Japan and other Asia-Pacific regions outside of China and Japan all accelerated in the fourth fiscal quarter, such as India, Southeast Asia and Africa, which have low smartphone penetration rates and huge market potential, are also growing rapidly. At the same time, Apple is also promoting the relocation of the industrial chain, especially to emerging markets such as India, with a view to further reducing costs, expanding production capacity and developing new market growth points.

# What the hell is it?

Autolus Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in CAR-T cell therapies aimed at treating various cancers. Their flagship product, Aucatzyl (obecabtagene autoleucel), targets relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL).

# Recent Developments

* **FDA Approval:** On November 8, 2024, the FDA approved Aucatzyl for adult patients with r/r B-ALL, marking a significant milestone for the company. ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/autolus-therapeutics-reports-third-quarter-120000687.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Clinical Data Publication:** The New England Journal of Medicine published data from the pivotal Phase 1b/2 FELIX study of Aucatzyl, reporting a 76.6% overall response rate with a low incidence of severe immune-related toxicities. Needless to say, this is a huge deal.

# Financial Health

As of Q3 September 30, 2024, Autolus reported:

* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** $657.1 million, up from $239.6 million as of December 31, 2023. ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/autolus-therapeutics-reports-third-quarter-120000687.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Total Operating Expenses:** $67.9 million for Q3 2024, compared to $42.9 million for the same period in 2023.
* **Net Loss:** $82.1 million for Q3 2024, up from $45.8 million in Q3 2023.

The company estimates that its current cash reserves are sufficient to support the full launch and commercialization of Aucatzyl in r/r adult B-ALL, as well as advance its pipeline development plans.

# Technical Analysis

(Take this part with a grain of salt, because I'm 100% regurgitating the information I found.) The stock is trading above its short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating a potential bullish trend.

* **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 14-day RSI is at 37.34%, suggesting the stock is approaching oversold territory.
* **Stochastic Oscillator:** 14-day value at 31.91%, also indicating potential oversold conditions.
* **MACD:** The MACD line is below the signal line, a bearish indicator suggesting downward momentum.
* **Support and Resistance Levels:**
   * **Support:** $2.80
   * **Resistance:** $3.50

Breaking above the $3.50 resistance could signal a bullish reversal, while dropping below the $2.80 support may lead to further declines.

# Bull Case

* **Regulatory Milestone:** FDA approval of Aucatzyl positions Autolus as a key player in the CAR-T therapy market.
* **Strong Clinical Data:** High response rates with low toxicity enhance the therapy's market potential.
* **Solid Cash Position:** With over $657 million in cash, the company is well-funded for commercialization and pipeline development.
* **Analyst Optimism:** Analysts have set **an average price target of $10.20**, suggesting significant upside potential. ([Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/autl/forecast/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

# Bear Case

* **Market Competition:** The CAR-T therapy space is competitive, with established players like Novartis and Gilead.
* **Financial Losses:** Increasing net losses may raise concerns about long-term profitability.
* **Execution Risks:** Challenges in manufacturing, distribution, and market adoption could impact commercial success.

# Conclusion

Autolus Therapeutics has achieved significant milestones with the FDA approval of Aucatzyl and promising clinical data. While the stock has experienced recent volatility, sure, the long-term outlook appears positive, especially considering the potential market impact of their CAR-T therapies. Therefore, especially considering that analysts believe this is either a strong buy or simply undervalued, this is a great play for the next 12 months. That being said, you do you, and manage your own risks. **Biotech is notoriously high risk, high reward, so keep that in mind.**

South Korean markets were already insanely cheap before this dip, trading at 11-12x earnings, compared to 31x earnings for the US markets.

Positions: Buying EWY today

edit: I bought EWY at $53-54. It's at $55.50 now, I wouldn't buy above $55 unless the situation is resolved and fx rates recover, because IMO korean stocks will dip when their market opens.

edit 2: Korean Parliament voted to overturn the martial law declaration, also their Finance Minister stated that unlimited liquidity injections and other measures will be enacted if necessary to maintain stability. I'm holding for now, but refraining from buying more unless it dips below $54 again.

edit 3: Military is saying martial law still in effect until the president cancels it. I'm being cautious, sold some at $55.30 but still holding most, not buying any more at this price bc at this point most of the remaining drop can be attributed to fx rates, I think Koreans will dump stocks when their market opens in the morning.

Edit 4: president says he'll end martial law. That was fun. ez gains. At this point the drop in price is roughly equal to the Korean won's depreciation, suggesting that the market is pricing the korean market opening flat.

As the global market leader in cloud computing, $$Amazon (AMZN)$$ Amazon AWS's latest move suggests that it's going all-in on [AI.AWS](http://AI.AWS) CEO Matt Garman recently said that AI is a never-ending race and promised to release “major “ updates to AI products

AWS' AI strategy: long-term growth vs. short-term incentives

AWS' continued investment in R&D for AI technology has given it a strong position in the market. From infrastructure support (e.g., in-house chips Inferentia and Trainium) to service-level AI models and development tools, AWS is building a complete ecosystem. This update may focus on the following areas:

Generative AI services: the key to competing with Microsoft and Google may be to expand the application scenarios of already existing AI services, such as healthcare, finance and other high value-added industries

Model optimization and cost reduction: through hardware improvement and algorithm optimization, it is cheaper and more efficient for customers to run AI models in the cloud.

Industry customized solutions: AWS's industry cloud strategy may be further deepened to create customized solutions for customers with the help of AI.

For investors, AWS's AI strategy is not only related to the market share of its cloud computing business, but also directly affects Amazon's overall revenue [performance.AWS](http://performance.AWS) already contributes nearly 70% of Amazon's operating profit, and further strengthening of its AI technology and services will help Amazon consolidate its position as a tech giant and provide sustained growth momentum for its stock (AMZN), which is currently on an uptrend that expects the stock to reach $230 in the next two months.

SP500 Historical PE Ratio indicates market correction?,1h5jece,_maverick98,2024-12-03 14:38:34,36,0.7,84,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h5jece/sp500_historical_pe_ratio_indicates_market/,"I've been looking into the historical PE ratio of the SP500, to get an overall indication of how the market was during each year and how it faired leading up to a crash. 

From the 50s up until the 90s the SP500 PE ratio was fluctuating between 10-20. Before the dotcom bubble bursting the PE ratio was almost 30 (and then it went up not because the prices went up, but because the earnings went down due to the bubble bursting).

Same thing before the 2008 crash, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in Sep 2008 and the PE ratio was trending around 28 points before that. Then the PE ratio was corrected and until 2016 it was below 20 points again.

Finally we can see that in the last 5 years the PE ratio has been inflated and trends between 20 - 25 points, except for 2020 where earnings went down so it went to 30. 

Currently we are at 27 points and are approaching 30 without having a major event to cause earnings to drop which means prices are super inflated. Someone may just say that things in the market have changed meme stocks etc. but the basics always remain the same. 

I believe we can't reach PE ratio of 30 and above without having a big correction in the next 1-2 years, even if people say that bull markets last >5 years",2024-12-03,-0.7725,Negative,"['PE', 'PE', 'PE', 'PE', 'PE', 'PE', 'PE']"

MRNA Turnaround,1h5bqf9,YouAlwaysHaveAChoice,2024-12-03 06:58:14,418,0.93,299,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h5bqf9,"What’s up guys?  Check my profile if you want to see the original MRNA post.  I honestly couldn’t be happier with how today played out.  After a promising open, we saw a big shakeout as we dumped from 43.85 to 41.50.  We made a beautiful triple bottom there, and steadily climbed the rest of the day to finish  up 2.81% at 44.30.  Seeing buyers step in here like that is very encouraging, and it seems like the selling is over, at least in the short term.

On the daily, the trend line is broken in my opinion.  Decent volume, more than Thursday and Friday, but I’d like to see more like what we saw early last week.  But seeing a strong green candle close near the high of the day like that to break the trend is very encouraging to me.   On the hourly, I’m seeing an incredibly clean bull flag.  I’m also seeing the 50 day EMA ready to cross above the 100 day EMA.  This is very significant to me.  The last time that happened was on April 23.  The stock traded at 104 on that day, and ran to 168 by May 24.  I’m really hoping other traders see this cross and trend line break, and we get a big influx of volume tomorrow/rest of the week.  I’m sure most of you remember, but MRNA was one of THE meme stocks during covid.  When this thing picks up volume, it can make some insane daily swings, and it’s super fun to trade.  

The options data is still super bullish as well.  The put/call ratio on the volume was 0.17 today(extremely bullish).  The open interest is 0.28(very bullish).    My 45 calls are clearly the favorite here.  I highly doubt that is all WSB regards.  Someone else sees the same setup.  

According to their website, they are going to release their CMV vacccine phase 3 data before the end of the year.  If the data is positive, that could be a huge boost for their revenue, and therefore their stock price.  Our beloved Pharma Bro agrees with that sentiment, and recently called the stock a buy on his stream.   I’m wondering if someone thinks they’ll release the data this week, and that it’ll have a positive impact on the price.  

Some concerns:  CMV data being bad = tank.  They could also pull a Ryan Cohen and do a stock offering on a very positive day.  I’ve found some conflicting numbers, but it seems their cash on hand is around 11-12 billion.  Pretty solid, but they’re burning almost a billion a quarter.  This could ruin any potential big runs(at least temporarily, screwing short term call holders).  Also, it could just start going back in the shitter for no reason like it’s been doing for months and this is just another dead cat bounce.  


I noticed some interesting developments over the weekend as well.  The number of very recent articles about avian flu is surprising.  I can’t link articles here for some reason, but just search and you’ll be surprised.  I believe 55 people have been infected so far, and a lot of milk/egg products have been contaminated.  The cases have been mild, but mutations can occur rapidly.   Back in July, the government gave MRNA 176 million dollars to research an avian flu vaccine.  Given their relationship from Covid, I think MRNA is very well positioned to make significant money if this becomes a bigger problem.
That might be why the stock is seeing more interest.  

As for me, I’m still holding my 12/6 45c’s.  I’m going to see what tomorrow brings. I’m cautiously optimistic.  I have a feeling we see $45 tomorrow, but I’m watching $46.  Thats where it was rejected a week ago.  If we break that, then back test and hold, I’ll be very happy.  My calls are currently up 30% because i bought on Friday.  If i can get 100% or better, It’ll be hard not to sell.  If you’re holding calls, consider the concern I laid out and make your own decision.  Pay attention to the volume tomorrow and Wednesday, that will be key.  None of this is financial advice, just sharing my own thoughts.

$PL - Earth Data to Become Increasingly Valuable Under Trump Administration,1h59vbt,cfmsiw,2024-12-03 05:30:18,441,0.87,177,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h59vbt/pl_earth_data_to_become_increasingly_valuable/,"Alright, cat has gotten out of the bag while I have been writing this and Planet Labs is no longer a secret. This analysis is not written by ChatGPT, hopefully not nauseatingly sales-y, and has no regarded emojis or over the top use of “To the Moon”. No frills, just my take on where I think there is deep value.

**Overview:**  
Earth observation data as a business has long struggled to be profitable. It requires significant CAPEX, is high risk (strapping a cam to a rocket essentially), and the R+D on a lot of the imaging can be pretty exorbitant. The main leader in the space, Planet Labs, went public in the SPAC boom. As a whole, they’ve underperformed the promises they presented in their first prospectus. Planet Labs sought to be a ""One to Many"" data provider, and their main selling point was that earth data could be widely commercialized. While this is still fundamentally true, in the time since going public they have essentially become a government contractor (75% revenue from some form of government with only a quarter from general business use) (source: Q2 Investor Presentation). Revenue being sourced primarily from the government is two sides of the same coin and the value lies in the eye of the beholder: it's bad because they are too reliant on too few customers, or that government revenue is extremely sticky and a major growth driver under the right administration. I am of the latter opinion.

I think we are at an inflection point that could cause Planet Labs to become far more profitable than they are currently, which will cause their valuation to adjust higher (far higher than even their recent run-up). While the use cases for the their data is very broad, it has become evident in the last few years that the most profitable one is government use.

**My thesis lies in the following:**

1. Donny and a Republican majority House/Senate will have a much larger Defense and Intelligence budget. They will be willing to pay a premium to obtain top tier defense and intelligence data from vendors like $PL.
2. NATO contract is highly promising (https://spacenews.com/planet-signs-deal-with-nato-to-supply-satellite-imagery/) and is a first of its kind deal. Follow-on mandates to come if $PL executes.
3. Launch of Tanager-1 (a first of its kind methane specific tracking satellite - highly valuable for int'l governments seeking to gather data on parties with the most harmful emissions) and subsequent release of data should bolster top-line (new sales team will hopefully execute).

Also before you ask, why can’t RKLB, SpaceX, etc. just strap cameras to their rockets? Or why can’t Starlink tack some cameras on their satellites? Boiled down most simply: they can’t do it efficiently or cost-effectively. They’d have to divert time and resources away from their primary businesses (which already have their own significant challenges) just to fight an uphill battle; this can be discussed more at length if clarity is needed but I just don’t see it as a likely scenario. Generally speaking this would more likely materialize as a continued symbiotic relationship (Planet Labs uses SpaceX rockets to launch their satellite constellations for example).

**Other thoughts:**  
Larger market cap compared to closest peer, no debt, invests more heavily in development of new technologies (I view this as a plus long term - they understand that earth images can be commoditized and are spending heavily to develop a suite of analytics products which can materially enhance user experience - this will create competitive advantage long-term; and yes before you ask, their data is being used to train AI models - see Laconic deal today - perfect example of their R+D spend beginning to pay off), recently trimmed workforce (leaner operating structure), largest and highest-quality satellite fleet (and it's not even close - actually a staggering difference), multiple partnerships with Google (Google owns \~12%), rumors are circling that they will finally announce positive adj EBITDA either this quarter or next (management has been targeting Q4)

**Position and Price Target**:  
I am planning to update this and positions continuously; I do believe in the growth of PL and will likely add on. May roll the 12/20’s, not decided yet.

Position:  
12/20/2025 $5C 9x  
4/17/2025 $5C 4x

Target: $PL 5/1/2025: $10/share

**TLDR:**  
Earth data used for defense and intelligence will become significantly more valuable over the next year due to major administrative tailwinds. Donny's Department of Defense will award more government contracts at a higher value, which will finally let them scale in the way they were meant to (R+D, Capex, and cash burn from last few years will all be justified by a stronger top-line). The mature business model for $PL is essentially a software company with high gross margins. The margin expansion will finally be realized as more contracts are awarded and valuations will correct accordingly. Additionally, while they do seek to serve a wide array of industries (i.e. agriculture, natural resources, etc.) the biggest short term tailwinds (I think) will be defense and intelligence contracts.

Also - it is impossible to have covered all the bases in this, so shoot your questions below and let's discuss. Happy to try and answer/clarify any of the above points. Lastly, I am a complete regard lol I could be wrong; not financial advice.",2024-12-03,0.9979,Positive,"['CAPEX', 'SPAC', 'PL', 'NATO', 'PL', 'RKLB', 'AI', 'PL', 'PL', 'TLDR', 'PL']"

With that out of the way, let's discuss our favorite Chinese company: Alibaba ($BABA).

Alibaba is China's largest e-commerce company and technology conglomerate.

They operate the following businesses:

|Category|Business|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|E-Commerce|Taobao|China’s largest consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplace|
|E-Commerce|Tmall|B2C platform for brands and businesses targeting Chinese consumers|

|Digital Media & Entertainment|Youku|Video streaming platform similar to YouTube|
|Digital Media & Entertainment|Alibaba Pictures|Film production and distribution company​|
|Digital Media & Entertainment|Damai|Event ticketing platform|
|Financial Services|Ant Group|Parent company of Alipay, which offers mobile payments, wealth management, lending, and insurance services, as well as a range of other fintech offerings such as MYbank and Ant Fortune. Alibaba owns a 33% stake|
|Retail and Other Services|[Ele.Me](http://Ele.Me)|Food delivery service operating in China|
|Retail and Other Services|Freshippo (Hema)|Online-to-offline grocery retail chain offering fresh food and home delivery|
|Retail and Other Services|DingTalk|Business communication and collaboration platform|
|Retail and Other Services|Alibaba Health|Health service platform providing digital healthcare and e-pharmacy solutions​. Alibaba owns a 66% stake.|

It's a ridiculously large conglomerate of mostly loss-leading industries.

The primary drivers of income are the E-Commerce, Cloud, and Logistics segments, which subsidize the high growth subsidiaries.

I'm not going to dive into the business qualitatively, although there's plenty of qualitative reasons to be bullish on China at this point:

1. [PCAOB has full access to the accounting for Alibaba](https://pcaobus.org/news-events/news-releases/news-release-detail/pcaob-secures-complete-access-to-inspect-investigate-chinese-firms-for-first-time-in-history#:~:text=Public%20Company%20Accounting%20Oversight%20Board,time%20in%20history%2C%20in%202022); PwC (Big 4) is Alibaba's auditor
2. [Tech Crackdown has essentially been over for a year.](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3227753/timeline-chinas-32-month-big-tech-crackdown-killed-worlds-largest-ipo-and-wiped-out-trillions-value)
3. [Stock recently connected to the Chinese exchanges, allowing Chinese citizens to purchase the stock](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US/document-1769951994501398528) (it has never dipped below the price of $83/share, where it traded on September 9 prior to this inclusion. Chinese owners have only ever seen green)
4. [Alibaba's Qwen AI is topping the charts in model ranking.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibabas-large-language-model-tops-093000912.html) (Just don't ask it about Tiannanmen Square)
5. [China is gearing up a massive stimulus plan.](https://in.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/this-is-when-china-is-likely-to-present-new-significant-fiscal-stimulus-plan-db-4552712)

These are all certainly catalysts, but I think the fundamental analysis is far more interesting.

Based on their trailing 12 month earnings and current balance sheet, at 200B Market Cap, Alibaba trades on these multiples:

|Multiple|BABA|S&P500|S&P 500 Premium (Discount)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|1.5|3.1|106%|
|P/E|17.7|29.7|67%|
|Operating Margin|15%|12%|(25%)|
|P/OI (Operating Income)|10|25.8|158%|
|Forward P/E|10|24|140%|
|P/B|1.55|5|223%|
|P/FCF|11|24.3|121%|
|EV/EBITDA|8.8|17.5|99%|
|PEG Ratio (Assuming 5% Growth)|3.5|6|71%|

Generic fundamental ratios look beautiful compared to the S&P 500 for BABA, but that's just the start.

Alibaba's net book value is highly liquid, with significant portions of its long term assets stored in equity investments. Realistically, Alibaba is both a China ETF with its equity holdings, and a core business.

Thus, subtracting book value from the market cap and using operating income gives us a better picture of the market's valuation of Alibaba's earnings (which excludes gains/losses from interest+investments)

|Metric|BABA|SP500|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Market Cap|200B|\~48T|
|P/B Ratio|1.5|5|
|Market Cap - Book  Value|67B|\~38T|
|Operating Income|20B|\~1.86T|
|Book Value Adj. Market Cap / Operating Income|3.35|\~20.4|

Just, wow. When you subtract Alibaba's net book value and place a multiple on the operating income alone, Alibaba trades at 3.35x income, as opposed to the SP500 index 20.4. That's a 508% premium for the SP500.

By the above metrics, Alibaba trades at a 50-75% discount to intrinsic value. Based on the current market cap, that's around 400-600B of intrinsic value.

**But wait! CHINA BAD!**

Absolutely, China Bad. So, let's caveat this with some data.

According to Polymarket, the highest yearly odds of China invading Taiwan is around \~20%.

Let's be as conservative as possible. Let's use Polymarket's highest yearly odds of China invading Taiwan as the odds of Alibaba stock going to Zero. Assuming Alibaba stock goes to Zero in this circumstance, let's see what the current market cap of Alibaba should be, adjusting for the risk, and using my bear case low end 400B intrinsic value.

|Alibaba Intrinsic Value|Chance of Happening|
|:-|:-|
|400B|80%|
|0 (War with China)|20%|

We take the calculated intrinsic value example (400B), multiplied by the chance of not going to zero (80%), and end up with 320B market cap, adjusted for the China Bad risk. That's **60% upside** from here.

In the bull case intrinsic value of 600B, multiplied by 80%, we end up with 480B market cap, adjusted for the China Bad risk. That's **140% upside** from here.

TL;DR: No matter how you slice it, even if you take the most conservative valuation metrics for Alibaba and pair them with the most bearish estimates of chance of war with China, Alibaba is still severely undervalued. Even a China bear could justify owning Alibaba at these prices.

Truth behind the MSTR Convertible Bond Arbitrage delta neutral gamma trading strategy to buy BTC,1h4yn3z,QuantRX,2024-12-02 21:46:27,60,0.92,100,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h4yn3z/truth_behind_the_mstr_convertible_bond_arbitrage/,"A lot of people on here are enticed to enter MSTR because of the juicy premiums and some folks wanted a more detailed explanation of what's going on and how Saylor is raising money paying zero coupons. Having worked in the Institutional fund side for awhile here's a little bit of insight.

What's happening is what is called a ""Convertible Bond Arbitrage delta neutral gamma trading strategy"" its a handful huh

Here Capital allocators such as hedge funds can trade around this option, which is essentially a very “out of the money” (OTM) option, by taking a “delta neutral” position. In other words, when these arbitrageurs buy the convertible bond, they simultaneously short a certain amount of the company's shares, making them delta neutral.

Lets take this example ...assume that these convertible bonds are issued with a delta of 0.5. To achieve a delta-neutral position, the hedge fund would short $500 worth of MicroStrategy stock for every $1000 worth of convertible bonds owned. As MicroStrategy stock rises and the option is more “in the money” (ITM), the hedge fund sells more MicroStrategy stock to remain delta neutral. When the convertible is well in the money, the delta for these traders typically approaches 1. At this point, the hedge fund is typically long $1000 worth of convertibles and short $1000 worth of MicroStrategy, which basically cancels out to 0.

The opposite is also true because when the stock falls, the hedge funds cover more of their short shares or buy shares to maintain their delta-neutral position. In this sense, these hedge funds are buying low and selling high, trading around the volatility of the stock and simply being long-gamma. This is probably also the reason why the short interest is so high at 14.41%.

We would go so far as to say that these convertible bondholders probably don't care about Bitcoin or where MicroStrategy shares are trading when conducting their arbitrage, as long as there is enough volatility to trade around. Remember that these capital allocators are likely delta neutral but net long gamma.

Reminder that these types of trades are very complicated and have to be continuously rebalanced to remain ""delta neutral"" so they can trade around this volatility... we dont have access to the type of market makers or financial products they have to make this possible.",2024-12-02,0.8119,Positive,"['MSTR', 'OTM', 'ITM']"

The pivotal trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in median overall survival (mOS) versus control.



Also Read: FDA Approves NovoCure's Portable Device Producing Tumor-Treating Electric Fields For Previously Treated Lung Cancer Patients



In the intent-to-treat population, patients treated with TTFields therapy concomitant with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel had an mOS of 16.20 months compared to 14.16 months in patients treated with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone, a statistically significant 2.0-month improvement (hazard ratio=0.819; *P*=0.039) (N=571).



The survival rate benefit for patients treated with TTFields therapy increased over time, with a 13% improvement in the overall survival rate at 12 months and a 33% improvement in survival rate at 24 months.



TTFields therapy was well-tolerated, and safety was consistent with prior clinical studies. Novocure plans to file for regulatory approval in the U.S., EU, Japan and other key markets. Zai Lab plans to file for regulatory approval in China.



Novocure continues to follow patients in its Phase 2 PANOVA-4 trial, which is exploring the use of TTFields therapy together with atezolizumab, gemcitabine, and nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. PANOVA-4 has completed enrollment, and data are anticipated in 2026.

T hasn't made it to the white house yet and he's already cleaning house and arranging furniture, meeting with heads of state as if he's really running things. He's lucky Elon is right there next to him doing the heavy lifting to make things more - efficient.

It got me wondering about the defense sector. The pentagon has failed every audit for the last several years which leads me to believe all these defense contractors are getting kick backs off the books but also their contracts might be over inflated and they taking advantage of Uncle Sam's check book because he doesn't really know what hes signing off on.

Its possible the Dept of Justice might sue them to pay back their, corrupt pricing over the years.

The other factor is Jan 20th inauguration day. Trump clearly said he's not paying a dollar more to Ukraine, so that means billions of dollars is no longer going to flow to the bottom line. Hezbollah and Israel signed a deal. So things are staring to look more peaceful. Zelensky said he might be willing to make concessions on land to make peace.

So the question is, are defense contractors overvalued?

About a year ago I dumped about 5k into a company that I may or may not have had private knowledge of. I thought I was so smart, turns out that less than a month later all my shares are worthless because the company filed for bankruptcy. 

Fast forward a couple months and my position was eliminated and I have been searching for jobs but been unemployed ever since. That 5k was a big chunk of my savings and with being unemployed and having bills to pay I quickly ran out of cash. I racked up about 12,000 in credit card debt and needed money fast. 

So naturally, I started gambling. I gambled by using this same credit card on some sketchy online casino, I didn’t deposit much at once, usually only $100 or so, but man I realized I had a gambling addiction once I spent over 4k on this site. I was making the money back but then I was chasing my losses and lost it all. 

Then autopay resumed on my card and tried to charge my entire balance which I didn’t have and Amex canceled my card. I was still making my monthly payments before that. 

So now I’m 16k in debt on this card, 3k on another, and have about $100 to my name. I sold my computers and guns and anything worth money but now I don’t know how I am going to pay my bills this month. 

Guys, please be careful, be honest with yourselves, casino gambling and options gambling are both just as dangerous. You have to limit yourself or else you are a few bad days away from being like me. 

I don’t know what I’m gonna do anymore but I thought I’d leave a warning for other degenerate gamblers like me.

BigBear.ai is flying under the radar but has massive potential. This is your chance to grab a future AI juggernaut while it's still cheap. There is a perfect storm of catalysts brewing (government contracts, strategic market positioning, and booming AI demand) - think Palantir but still in its early innings.

**What is it?**

Bigbear is an AI-powered decision-making and analytics platform with a strong focus on government contracts, particularly with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and intelligence agencies. Their software helps organizations predict, visualize, and act on complex data to drive better outcomes.

**Why has it been overlooked?**

1. Tiny market cap of around $550m.
2. Low institutional ownership of less than 10% - mostly VC and Retail (although this has been growing over the last few months).
3. Went public via SPAC so the share price dropped massively initially.

**What it has going for it**

1. Secured a 5-year $165m USD contract from the US Army in October - clearly working closely with government agencies.
2. 2024 Q3 22.1% revenue increase to $41.5m and an improved gross margin of 25.9%, despite a net loss of $12.2m.
3. It's cheap af - expecting FY24 revenue of up to $180m at just $550m market cap. Granted it is loss-making currently but so is RKLB, ACHR, etc..
4. Rated as a Strong Buy from Wall Street analysts.
5. Has diverse revenue streams in healthcare and warehousing, increasing addressable market (already have contracts with Amazon).
6. $437m backlog as of latest earning call.
7. Acquired Pangiam in 2023, a leader in facial recognition tech (CEO was former Director of Homeland Security).
8. The share price has been steadily rising over the past few months, but has yet to explode.

**Catalysts going forward**

Here we get a bit theoretical but I believe there is huge upside here for a few reasons:

1. Trump in office - more spending on defence and domestic security budgets (facial recognition is great for finding illegal immigrants hmmm).
2. It comes across as massively undervalued given it's current revenue and growth potential - trading at just over 3x forward revenue vs Palantir at 45x forward revenue.
3. Institutional ownership is rising fast - smart money is catching on for good reason.
4. Trend-wise, this stock fits the profile of something that will absolutely skyrocket on any positive news. AI deeptech, DoD contracts, growing revenue, and hugely overlooked.
5. It currently has 80 open positions on linkedin and with around 500 employees, this suggests they are investing hard for growth.

Basically, this is your chance to get in early on the next PLTR.

🚨Bag-holder DD alert: TWLO ALL IN with nvda sprinkles 🚨,1h4nlns,MassaOogway69420,2024-12-02 10:46:23,49,0.82,34,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h4nlns,"Maybe there is a bag-holder bug going around... I hope my case isn't too bad. 

Tldr:
I'm all in TWLO with nvda sprinkles because Twilio is an ""AI pick and shovel"" play that is being heavily slept on lol. AI is going to the moon. TWLO is also trading at a significant discount relative to its SaaS peers. 

Just look at its weekly chart. Durrrr. 

Also, I don't think I have to say anything about NVDA besides ""buy the dip.""

Real TLDR at very bottom if you don't wanna read. 




Why am I being regarded?


1. I've been inspired by people like ElonIloveyou or whatever that guy's name is, and hopefully, if I hop on the wave quick enough, I can ride it to Valhalla :) 


2. TWLO is SO cheap right now

Although it fell fantastically... what goes down must always go up?

- Current Price-to-Sales (P/S): 2.6x

This is drastically lower than SaaS peers like Snowflake (25x) or ServiceNow (14x). For context, Twilio’s P/S ratio peaked at 20x plus during its high-growth phase in 2021.

- Enterprise Value (EV) to Revenue: 3.8x 

This is also much lower than peers (Smartsheet at 5.6-5.7x, ServiceNow at 12.5-13.8x, ZoomInfo at 7.7x).


3. Although they aren't profitable (who tf is and who cares), their revenue growth is strong and growing and their & margins are healthy.

- Revenue (TTM): $4.07 billion (a solid 10% YoY growth in a tough macro environment)

- Gross margins are stabilizing at 50%

- Cash Balance: $3.8 billion

TWLO has also maintained very low debt compared to peers


4. TWLO has many tailwinds

- Twilio’s recent initiatives include embedding generative AI and predictive analytics into its platforms. TWLO's most recent guidance signaled this advancement to be a significant revenue driver long term.

- Twilio has implemented significant cost-cutting measures and achieved $150 million in annualized savings in Q3 - by focusing on core high-margin products while exiting non-core businesses (Prolly some more tech layoffs around the corner across the board).

- Valuable collabs with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Salesforce enhance Twilio’s market reach.

- The global CPaaS (Communications Platform as a Service) market is expected to grow from $12 billion in 2023 to $35 billion by 2030, representing a CAGR of ~16%. Twilio dominates this space.

- HEAVY INSTITUTIONAL ACCUMULATION HAS OCCURRED RECENTLY. Vanguard and BlackRock have increased their stakes. The big fish are confident in the TWLO turn aruond story.


5. The technical ANALysis says calls, I think.  

- TWLO has broken above its 200-day moving average

- Key support levels: $102, $98.50, $92.

- Resistance levels: $110, $115, and $120.

- High open interest in near-term $110 and $115 calls, super DUPER low IV... maybe for a reason, but idk.


TLDR:
TWLO Is Primed for Upside because:

- Twilio is heavily discounted on all valuation metrics, providing a high margin of safety.

- AI-driven products and cost optimizations are setting the stage for sustained margin growth.

- Technical and options data suggest growing institutional and retail interest.

If you’re looking for a quality tech SaaS play at value-stock prices, Twilio deserves a spot on your radar. Shares and/or options will definitely hit, probably. 

I posted my positions. Not sure when I’ll sell…I will likely be the catalyst for the next leg up.

I'm not coming at this from a technical or fundamental perspective, so there are some things to explain for those that don't understand. But also want to hear others perspectives, even the bears (respectfully if possible hah)

I'm not a trader by any means. I'm in Reddit because my background is giving me some new perspective on the potential. 

My background is in SEO (search engine optimization). I know the search engines. I know how websites are monetized. I've seen hundreds of millions of dollars pass through the hands of clients, bloggers, ecom stores I've owned, CPA offers and leveraging social media, etc etc 

There's an endless supply of money on the web via ad revenue, product referrals, and money to be had without actually selling a thing. If you don't understand how ad revenue is generated on the web, it similar to traditional advertising models. Traditionally you would charge by CPM (cost per 1000 impressions). An impression is simply someone seeing an ad. For example if a billboard company sells you an ad space it's based on the amount of people that travel down the freeway. So if the freeway has 10k traffic everyday thats 10k impressions a day and the advertising company sets a price for the CPM. 

With the web you have more avenues to monetize. But the majority of monetizing with ads is via CPCs and CPM. CPC = cost per click. We can get into marketing funnels and offers and yada yada but thats not how a company like Reddit is going to monetize. I've seen little dinky websites that leverage ranking web pages for keywords in Google make big $$. One example is a DUI attorney I worked with in Phoenix who had a blog. So you understand how blog monetization works just go to any blog and look at their ads on the page, and possible affiliate links inside of the content. Anyhow, for the DUI attorney his ads in the side bar of his blog were earning him on average $40 per click. Everytime someone clicked an ad on his page he made approx $40. ""dui attorney phoenix"" currently has a range of $30 - $225 per click and get and avg of $82 per click as one example. His adsense account made $10k a month roughly on a blog that was getting about $20k in monthly traffic. Reddit has 1.2 billion in unique organic visitors every month. And growing

Reddit is in it's infancy when it comes to monetizing their traffic and really leverging their ads such as a company like Facebook/Meta.

However, it has more organic traffic than Amazon. Last I checked Reddit was fluctuating between #5 and #7 in terms of sites with the largest traffic. 

Amazon IPO'd at $18 a share. They adjusted shares 480x (not sure if that number is 100% correct, but I think it is) which means the current share price since IPO without splits is about $99k per share. 

If Reddit closes the gaps in 3 areas...

Dials in their ad monetization  
Launches a Marketplace  
Capitalizes on local search traffic

It's my opinion this could easily be $1000+ a share. Market cap is a measly 25 bil. 

NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE this is only my outlook based on the possibility with leveraging search traffic and monetizing it, the possibility that being the 5th largest traffic driver on the web brings, and why I'm invested.

I’ve spent hours gathering, analyzing, and organizing all the information to present it here for you. I hope it brings clarity to the complexities surrounding Supermicro. As always, everything here represents my personal opinion and is not financial advice or a recommendation.

# Quick Overview

Who Shorted Regional Banks Due to CRE Exposure?

With all the talk about the potential fallout from the CRE sector over the past few years, I’m curious to know who took the plunge and shorted these banks earlier in 2023 or 2024?

Did it work as expected? Any surprises, like a stronger-than-anticipated rebound in bank performance, or did CRE exposure finally start to eat away at their balance sheets?

What’s the outlook on this trade? Do you think the worst of the CRE fallout is yet to come, or is the market pricing in the potential for a prolonged slump?

MRNA bounce incoming ,1h2zgtn,YouAlwaysHaveAChoice,2024-11-30 05:26:21,996,0.89,609,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h2zgtn,"Good evening degens.  Last weekend I made a DD about NVDA breaking its upward trend line this week and selling off.  The post was downvoted to hell and I was called regarded.  Although I am highly regarded, that call out was not, and I was right.  I have another play for next week I’d like to share.  

We all remember Moderna(MRNA) from the Covid era.  The stock ran from $30 to $500 in about a year and a half.  It has since been absolutely butt fucked into oblivion.  Covid shot revenue is drying up and they are scrambling to find other sources.   On top of that, RFK plans to basically put them out of business(if he gets approved, which I don’t think he will).   Regardless, this play is not long term, although I do think this is a really good buy spot if you are hopeful about their long term business(which you should be).  Also, the stock got an upgrade from hold to buy by HSBC with a $58 price target, and there were multiple articles pondering whether the stock was sold off enough to warrant buying here, all of which advise buying.  These articles don’t mean shit, but it’s positive sentiment.  

Again,  THIS IS A SHORT TERM PLAY.  LIKE ONE WEEK, MAYBE TWO.  Now for the charts.   You can see on the daily it’s been in a solid downtrend since it had a little run in May.  But I think that is coming to end this week, at least temporarily.  The price double bottomed nicely at $35 last week.  I’ve been looking for this level because this was resistance/support 4 different times back in 2020(long time ago, but in my brain it matters).  I think this will be a hard number to crack, especially since selling seems to be exhausted.  Those selling at this level are very likely selling for a large loss, and I think those that want to jump ship have already done so.  

On the daily, we are right on the trend line and the stock is at support.  This is the EXACT same setup as NVDA last week, except NVDA was breaking down after a big run, and I expect MRNA to break up after a massive ass whooping.  You can also see that volume has been much higher the past 2 weeks.  I believe smart, wealthy buyers are stepping here and loading the boat, and some are buying short term call options for next week, which brings me to the put call ratio.  

The first graph is the put call ratio for this past week.  You can see a slightly bullish lean with a ratio of 0.5, but there was a fair amount of put open interest at the 42,41, and 30 strikes, all of which expired worthless.  The next graph is the open interest for next week.  A ratio of 0.24 is extremely bullish, with 31,634 active call options and 7,536 puts.   You do not have that kind of ratio on a stock that’s been sinking like the Titanic unless smart money thinks that the selling is done and the stock is due for a reversal.   I was on the fence about this play until I looked at the option chain. 

I’m currently in the 12/6 45 calls.  I’m hoping to see a clear break of the trend line monday or Tuesday on strong volume, and would love to see a test of $50 at some point.  If i see a clear rejection at the trend line and it looks like it’ll test $35 again, I’ll stop out.  I’m pretty confident in this one tho, about as confident as I was in the NVDA play.  

Best of luck if tailing, and this is not financial advice.

Finally Hit $100k in Robinhood After Years of Grind,1h2y4dg,Elfstone_Maven_728,2024-11-30 04:21:59,4355,0.95,290,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h2y4dg,"First post ever on Reddit albeit a long one so buckle up fellow degens!
Been lurking for 6 years, finally made a new Reddit account to share this milestone. Started this journey back in 2017 in Robinhood, rode the highs and lows, and at one point even saw my portfolio drop to just ~$1K back in July 2022 (see screenshot #2) . But here we are in 2024, looking at ~$110k and up $47k (~76%) all-time! (Still quite can’t beat the benchmark yet; SPY’s got me outpaced in the long term 🥲)

The Ups and Downs

Looking back, it’s been one heck of a rollercoaster. As you can see in my all-time chart, there were some major dips along the way. The journey wasn’t linear; there were times when I felt like the portfolio was just bleeding out, but I stuck with it, made some strategic moves, and kept adding funds whenever possible. 

After starting with the modest account balance of about roughly 18k back in Q4 2017, I steadily added funds to my portfolio over time, especially after seeing triple digit returns in NVDA, SQ and double digit gains in bunch of blue chip stocks; held some Chinese stocks like Luckin Coffee (before it got delisted from NASDAQ) . Got the account to a decent level.
Then went completely ‘regard’ and got into options 😅. Did well initially then hit the rock bottom reaching as low as $998 (see aforementioned screenshot #2). Added about 9-12k over next few months (see screenshot #3) to be able to trade again. No options but used margin money to almost double my account first. Then, as the bull market kicked in after bottoming out in October 2023, the account continued to rise. Later, I employed slightly more aggressive options strategies to reach my current position.

Key Moves 
The past 18 months have been all about- researching a shit ton (more!) and making mostly informed decisions mixing with some gut feeling, using Reddit (of course), stocktwits, yahoo finance, various research firms, reports, interviews, Fidelity, CNBC, etc

Current Portfolio includes: 
•	PLTR, bunch of Semi stocks including NVDA, TSM.
•	Blue Chips (duh!) 
•	Growth stocks like SOFI, SQ, 
 •	ETFs and a few dividend/yield stocks like QQQ, IJH, XLE, JPEQ, etc. 
•	Credit Put Spreads, LEAPS, CSPs, and CCs
	•	PLTR and semi stocks, plus bluechi
Missed out on a 10x gain on NVDA (sold too early); funny enough never went long on TSLA or got into some of the group’s fav stonks from back in 2020-21 (you know which ones 💪🏽), but holding PLTR since 2020 has been solid.
I also hold stuff long term on other platforms- Fidelity and Webull including most of my PLTR shares. Can’t go full degen and YOLO everything just on Robinhood alone; you gotta diversify 😭

"Quadrupled Down.

Here's the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h0dgpq/stock\_is\_trading\_at\_alltime\_lows\_with\_a\_sub2b/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h0dgpq/stock_is_trading_at_alltime_lows_with_a_sub2b/)

1. I quadrupled Down: Throughout the day, I added to my position every time I read a bearish comment that ignored the three core pillars of the thesis: Kohl’s cash position, net asset value, and dividend yield. **As of now, I’m $130K deep into this trade.**
2. This is a pure value play: Kohl’s isn’t suddenly going to become the next Amazon, and that’s fine. The thesis isn’t predicated on some retail turnaround miracle. This is a simple value play: I’m buying $2 worth of assets for $1. Kohl’s NAV dwarfs its market cap, and it throws off real cash flow.
3. New CEO: the markets reaction (and many of the comments) was that the new CEO is a bearish signal, makes no sense. The new CEO is the guy who turned around Michaels in 2020 and SOLD IT TO APOLLO FOR $3B. The worst thing about Kohls management thus far has been their desire to not liquidate its most valuable asset (real estate) and instead simply return cash flow to shareholders. I’m not complaining about the latter, but the former would’ve been an $8B sale in 2022 if management had agreed to it. Currently trading for $1.5B with the same real estate assets on the book.
4. Bag Holding vs. Conviction: There are times when you feel like a bag holder and hopium is your drug. And then there are times where when it goes down you calmly buy more. And in the latter times, you want to bring everyone along for the ride. Getting rich alone isn’t meaningful.

Anyways, the YTD pattern thus far for $ZTO seems to indicate that buy/sell volume is cyclical, while maintaining a very nice positive slope for the bottoms. RSI(14) indicates it is oversold right now, and for every time this year that $ZTO has been oversold, the price of the shares will move back up from that point. Conversely, qhen the RSI is overbought, it goes down. The fact that this pattern can be observed is why I have bought options contracts at the strikes I did *($20-$22 strikes-ish, see in 2nd pic)*

$ZTO is a solid Chinese giant with 26 analyst ratings that give it a 92% buy score, with a target price of $21.20/share.

The companies rolls in a profit of $1.2B, with sales of about $5.83B, and has very low to non-existent debt of 0.01 LTDebt/Eq and pays roughly a 5% dividend. It has a nice low, but positive P/E of 13, and EPS has been positive through the year. There isn't much to not like about this stock right now.

If you're feeling frisky, buy some call options like I did, otherwise, this is a company I would buy shares outright for and wait for the next top to sell off at. I'm personally expecting a movement to the target price before January 17th.

Of course I am not going to trade off of my feelings, only when confirmation comes but I genuinely cannot shake it.

We are resting just above major support formed over past few months. I expect volume to be low due to thanks giving so may just be overthinking but there is not much buyer interest and much less accumulation occurring, this may change when open comes round.

Does anyone believe we could dump today or am I just being regarded.

NVDA also seems to have very little buyer interest but I don't trade or even watch NVDA. There was a FVG created on the daily which could be why but even then, resting under support with little accumulation concerns me.

Happy to hear everyone's thoughts.

Michael Saylor went on CNBC this week and said bitcoin has returned 60% annually since inception and he predicts a more modest 29% annual return over the next 10 years. He neglected to mention that less than 1% of all bitcoin volume was before 2018. This would be like saying Microsoft returned 327,401% since IPO so we expect a modest 100,000% return over the next 30 years.

It is easily verifiable that bitcoin tracks almost identical to the 2x nasdaq. In 2022 bitcoin fell 75% in 10 months, coincidentally the same time we had the highest CPI prints in 40 years. No store of value or inflation hedge can fall 75% in 10 months by definition. Just this past week bitcoin fell 10% in two days!

In 2017 I saw someone on CNBC saying that with adoption the volatility will go down. It is seven years later and volume adjusted volatility is significantly higher than then. Also, this is just something people say with no evidence. Just an assumption.

Remember when everyone was waiting for bitcoin ETFs to be announced and someone hacked the SEC's twitter account and sent the price of BTC up 5% instantly? What store of value can be this manipulated over a tweet? Imagine if someone hacked trumps truth social account, or a government page, or any of the other government officials around the world that are involved in bitcoin. There are no circuit breakers on crypto exchanges and there are insane amounts of leverage in bitcoin.

There is nothing stopping any bad actor or state from manipulating the bitcoin market. Now that we are flooded with derivatives to short bitcoin, they can flood the market with bitcoin while shorting.

Why would the United States sell US dollars to buy bitcoin? Why would it sell gold and not give that money to the taxpayers or convert it to USD? What does it say about our confidence in our own currency if we decided to sell USD for bitcoin? It is frankly absurd, dangerous, and a waste of taxpayers money to pump up the bags of current bitcoin holders. They should instead sell their bitcoin and give that money back to its people that it serves. 30% of all bitcoin exists within the borders of China and Russia. We would hurt their holdings, instead of propping up their bags with our tax dollars.

If one hacked twitter tweet can move bitcoin in a 10% swing, what is bitcoin really?

I can absolutely lose on this trade. It is impossible to time bubbles. I do not even believe I have an edge on this trade. But I believe bitcoin is a giant ponzi scheme and I want to take a stab. I do not believe it is possible to gain an edge over a liquid market, or a derivatives market, but this is something I want to do because I believe with as much conviction as is possible that bitcoin is pure garbage.",2024-11-29,-0.8608,Negative,"['CNBC', 'IPO', 'CPI', 'CNBC', 'SEC', 'BTC', 'US', 'USD', 'USD']"
MicroStrategy in layman's terms,1h2dfxz,datthrowaway4522,2024-11-29 09:45:38,152,0.84,132,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h2dfxz/microstrategy_in_laymans_terms/,"It's been a while since the days of my regard college finance classes, but here is my understanding of MicroStrategy in layman's terms (kind of). Please correct me if anything is off.

The CEO of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, has been saying that Bitcoin is the future because he expects Bitcoin to be an alternative reserve currency that will take up a larger portion of the global reserve currency pool over time, so the value of Bitcoin will inevitably go up over time (whether you agree with this premise is for another day). MSTR has been gradually loading up on Bitcoin in recent years. Given the recent US election result, the incoming administration is signaling a more open and favorable view of crypto adoption (although it's not clear if/how this will happen), especially with the appointment of Elon Musk to a meme government entity named after a meme coin. This led to a huge rally in the crypto market, especially for Bitcoin and subsequently MSTR who has been loading up on Bitcoin for a while now.

Now this is where things get crazy: MSTR is taking advantage of their rise in stock price to go out and ask institutional investors to buy their 0% interest convertible bonds. As of the most recent round, these bonds are structured as 5-year in maturity with 0% interest rate and a convertible price of 130% of current market price. To make the math simple, MSTR is currently trading at around $400 per share, so the bond holders can either convert the bonds into shares at ($400)(130%) = $520 per share in 5 years or get their principal back. Saylor is selling the promise that Bitcoin will go up significantly in the next 5 years (e.g. Bitcoin's 4-year halving cycle), so it's a great bargain for the institutional bond holders because they are essentially giving up the 5-year interest payments in exchange for an embedded call option to buy MSTR at $520/share in 5 years. Ask yourself, how likely that MSTR will only go up by 30% and trade at around $520 in 5 years? This is essentially the selling point that has the new institutional buyers hooked (whether you agree is a different story, but the institutional buyers seem to agree for now). On the MSTR side, Saylor is using the money to acquire additional Bitcoin and continue to hype up the FOMO sentiment around Bitcoin without ever worrying about financing cost in the meantime due to the 0% interest nature of these bonds. This will likely continue to drive Bitcoin and MSTR prices higher and higher for sometime, so this ""free money glitch"" phenomenon can continue to go on for a little while, creating a positive loop for MSTR to continue buying up more Bitcoin. So far this is the surface level explanation for the Bitcoin and MSTR pump as long as institutional investors are still buying into their convertible bonds, but it gets crazier...

You may ask why would anyone, especially big institutional buyers, just not buy Bitcoin or Bitcoin funds directly? The simple answer is, it has something to do with the investment mandate prohibiting the trading of crypto directly since they are deemed as risky assets, so they resort to something like MSTR bond offering as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure because bonds are generally considered safer. This is what Saylor meant by ""we are a Bitcoin treasury company"" during his recent CNBC interview. But that's not the full story... These institutional buyers (think pension funds, insurance liabilities, sovereign wealth funds, etc.) also need to worry about hedging their volatility and limit loss exposure to this risky asset class called Bitcoin. In the equity market, this big IV is directly reflected in the costly option premiums; as vega goes up so do option prices. However, the cost of embedded call option from the convertible bond is materially lower due to the inflexible nature of the convertible bond (e.g. only redeemable in 5 years, interest rate risk, opportunity cost, less liquid bond market, etc.). In other words, the cost of embedded call option through convertible bond offering is only the interest payments lost over the 5-year horizon and nothing more (except MSTR goes completely belly up, which I'll explain why it's unlikely later). However, these institutions can also turn around and sell call options in the open equity market at a premium. This is essentially a replicating portfolio that seeks to exchange the lost interest payments from the 0% bond for the call option premiums at a strike price of $520 in 5 years. Then, there is also the cherry on top with additional arbitrage potential that exploits the inflexibility of the bond market and the more expensive option premiums in the equity market due to high IV. Say it differently, the effective yield on these bonds are most likely higher than selling a vanilla corporate bond that pays the current market yield. This is what Saylor meant by ""the way we make money is we are selling the volatility \[to big institutional bond buyers who are willing to take up the 0% interest for 5 years deal while MSTR pays no interests\] and recycling it back to Bitcoin \[use the bond proceeds to hype up Bitcoin more\].""

Now to address the elephant in the room: what if Bitcoin has a massive correction and MSTR goes belly up? The short answer is, it's not likely and it doesn't really matter. First of all, MSTR is taking advantage of Bitcoin's 4-year halving cycle and structuring its bond maturity around it with the hope of that Bitcoin continues to play out the way MSTR expected so the bond obligations can either convert or roll over, especially now with more players trying to mimic their play and further pumping Bitcoin. In the meantime, they have virtually no interest obligations to worry about on their newly issued 0% convertible bonds for the next 5 years. 5-year is a long time horizon, which means they have plenty of opportunities to offload if they sense that something is going in the wrong direction. Secondly, there were simulations done to show how much Bitcoin needs to drop for MSTR to force liquidate Bitcoin to pay its debt obligation. The consensus price range is around $15k to $30k (feel free to challenge this claim if you think otherwise), which is not very likely given Bitcoin's current trading price of around $100k; Bitcoin price needs to drop significantly for this scenario to play. And hopefully they would have started to offload sooner before it drops to that level as explained by the first reason above. Lastly, the institutions have already hedged their losses, so it doesn't matter. They are effectively selling a fancy put option where the most they can lose is missing out on the 5-year interest payments if MSTR goes downhill in 5 years (they would just get the principal back and they still have priority claim over stockholders if things go really wrong). That said, the more likely playoff is that the institutional investors buy the convertible bonds by forgoing 5 years of interest payments, sell calls in the equity market at a big premium due to high IV, convert the bonds into shares in 5 years, and give the shares to call holders while taking a fat profit in the process (i.e. right end of short put payoff graph plus maybe a little bit more). Not to mention that these are some of the biggest and most sophisticated players in the financial market, so they have every interest to ensure that MSTR doesn't go completely belly up. Therefore, MSTR is likely here to stay for now as it continues to attract more institutional attention.

In summary:

\- MSTR can go up or down or sideway and it doesn't matter because institutions always find ways to skim from regard retails like you and me

\- If MSTR goes up, your shares will forever get diluted by your fellow regard call holders from bond converts while institutions get a fat check playing middleman

\- If MSTR goes belly up, institutions will get their money back first while you take another load behind Wendy's dumpster

\- If MSTR trades sideway, you get theta ganged

Taking into account the crazy high dividends on CONY and MSTY. Why is it a bad thing to be long with a large play into both? 

For example, purchase a 1k shares of each… the monthly dividend would be exceptional. 

To protect against loss, buy long dated put contracts for the same funds. 

Reap the dividends while being protected on the initial investment via the put contracts. One months dividend will cover nearly all the premium of the contracts.

Net income doubled to $20 billion and the company showed a strong outlook for future quarters, slightly exceeding market expectations. However, while growth remains impressive, fourth-quarter expected revenue of $37.5 billion is growing at a slower pace, well below the strong growth seen in previous quarters (122%, 262%, 265%). Since then, market concerns about a possible trade war in China have intensified, causing shares to fall

The company's dominant position in artificial intelligence and its production capacity constraints mean that it still has plenty of room to grow its revenues.

NVIDIA recently reported strong earnings, but the stock pulled back on profit retrenchment. Nonetheless, I think this may provide a buying opportunity for investors

AI growth logic remains strong

NVIDIA's dominant position in data centers allows it to benefit from the $1 trillion wave of global AI infrastructure investment. Despite increased skepticism about the potential for AI expansion, company management remains confident in the demand for AI chips, with the CFO stating that demand for next-generation Blackwell chips is “phenomenal” and that large customers show no signs of slowing their drive to invest in AI

Short-term challenges and long-term potential

In the short term, NVIDIA may face supply constraints and margin dilution, but these issues are seen as temporary. Although the growth rate is slowing down due to the “law of large numbers”, long-term demand is expected to continue to grow with the advancement of enterprise AI and sovereign AI

Technical trends and investment recommendations

From a technical perspective, NVIDIA is in an overall uptrend and the current pullback has not created a clear bearish reversal. I believe that the volatility in the stock price provides a good opportunity to add to a position on the pullback. NVIDIA's forward-looking PEG ratio is below the industry median, indicating that its valuation remains attractive

While volatility is likely to continue in the short term, NVIDIA's leadership in AI and long-term growth potential make it a noteworthy investment target

Where are future returns even supposed to come from? ,1h1w2h9,Illustrious_Beach,2024-11-28 19:04:58,389,0.92,289,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h1w2h9/where_are_future_returns_even_supposed_to_come/,"Happy thanksgiving to all of you, I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones. Just some discussion points about overall valuations in the equity markets. 

This is something that I have wondered for a while. Almost every asset under the sun has skyrocketed, and obviously people are planning to get a return on their investment, so let's discuss how this is even supposed to happen at this point. 

First, there's the low hanging fruit in terms of arguments supporting that we are in a wildly overvalued equity bubble. Dogecoin is worth more than Nintendo. Palantir trades at nearly 60x revenue and made a nanopenny of earnings on a market cap that is nearing ASML's. Tesla is worth $1.1T and thus somehow larger than berkshire. Carvana. I'm not even going to talk about bitcoin. These are prime examples of rampant market speculation and I believe nobody who has their two brain halves connected would argue that these are not cult assets that are disconnected from reality. 

But digging a bit deeper, the bubble doesn't remotely seem to be isolated to certain sectors. Apple is a lick away from 40x earnings. Walmart trades at nearly 40x earnings. Costco somehow manages to sell at nearly 60x earnings. Eli Lilly commands an 85x multiple as an entry price. ServiceNow trades at nearly 175x GAAP eps. These aren't 2021-style ARKK stocks but the largest companies in the world. 

Nvidia is probably the greatest financial success story of all time but they too quickly need to find another $80 billion of annual earnings somewhere otherwise they will also eventually implode like a neutron star. And all of that is happening while the 10-year yields close to 4.5%!

I mean, I like walmart and I like costco. They are good companies. It's a sticky business and they have carved out a nice piece of the U.S. economy for themselves. But Walmart does nearly $700b in revenue and has 3% operating margins. The current EPS yield is barely 2.5%. What is supposed to happen here? Earnings isnt expected to skyrocket and that multiple is so stretched that even 10% yearly EPS growth may leave bulls without a return until 2034. Never, even in my fever dreams, would I have believed that a company like costco would command a 60x premium. 

It seems to me that nearly any asset imaginable is wildly overbought and that people are just pouring they paychecks into the stock market because it has a history of only going up and to the right. But multiples are arguably way ahead of themselves. Current CAPE-ratio has only been higher during two times in history: 1929 and the dotcom bubble. This is kind of a cliché but at the same time, owning these stocks nets you nearly nothing. So what's the game here? Are people betting that Costco will trade at 80x earnings next year? 

Everything I know as a value investor tells me that this must end and that it is time to hedge. But at the same time, anyone who has shorted this ridiculous market has been ground to a pulp by the onslaught of endless liquidity that's pouring into the market. 

So what do you guys think? Are the U.S. stock markets about to pull a Nikkei and leave us all grinding our teeth until 2040 before a new high will be set? Hope that turkey tastes well by the way. ",2024-11-28,0.9946,Positive,"['ASML', 'GAAP', 'ARKK', 'EPS', 'EPS', 'CAPE']"
I have reasons to believe that Recursion (RXRX) will became quite popular in the next month.,1h1volv,RainManKnight,2024-11-28 18:43:43,349,0.94,197,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h1volv/i_have_reasons_to_believe_that_recursion_rxrx/,"I believe that in the future, drugs will be highly customisable based on the patience’s health history. Based on your physiology, syndromes, and genetics, you may receive a drug that is well-suited for you and only you. 

How can you do that? First and foremost, you need data, huge amounts of it. We all know how generative and predictive models had advanced in the last year. It wasn’t in fact, until the launch of AlphaFold (by Google, whose team was recently awarded with the Chemistry Nobel Prize), that AI drug discovery became prominent. This open source model is used for molecular discovery. Again, would be nice if a company could:

1. Generate proprietary synthetic, good quality molecular data using models like AlphaFold.
2. Using this data to train models for drug discovery, reducing pipelines costs and times up to 50%.
3. Eventually, with the possibility of bringing the first AI-aided drug to the market.

First two points have been achieved, and the company is Recursion. We may know them because NVIDIA invested 50m in them. Why then are at ATL? I think the answer is time. We all know there is no room for patience when it comes to money sometimes. Training and bringing such results may take years.

However, I think another catalyst is coming. On 9. December, they will host a seminar for new readouts in one of their most well-known drugs in development, CDK7, for advance solid tumours (an inhibitor, which are currently none approved by the FDA).

Now, I am not saying that they will cure cancer - that’s BS. But over the years converging to novel oncological solutions using AI? This is not the only drug they have (other 9 are in development).

They have more than 60 petabytes of data.
They combined forces with Exscientia recently, forming probably the most important powerhouse of AI-drug research.
They are extremely active in the research field (see their presence in the upcoming NeuRIPS conference) or their new open dataset for Quantum Computing (OpenQDC).

I started investing in IONQ in 2021 for a similar impression. Now I am getting the same vibes with this. I feel that a small catalyst will put this to fly, although the real potencial will come in the next 5-10 years. If they can bring the first AI drug to the market,  this implodes.

I need help though putting together what I believe will be the ultimate payday plan if it all goes the way I believe it will.

I believe Bitcoin goes to at least $150,000 a coin this run, and most likely by May of 2025. The play I want to make is calls or longs on MicroStrategy ($MSTR) until the end of April of 2025, and then I want to reverse my position into puts or shorts to ride it all the way down when Bitcoin does its highly predictable cycle nosedive.

At this point, I'm not sure how MicroStrategy will do, because if Bitcoin loses its normal 50 to 80 percent, how does MicroStrategy justify itself until the next cryptocurrency cycle at some point in 2028 or 2029?

They do have 0% interest loans, so maybe nothing significant happens to them, because eventually Bitcoin always goes up and up, so maybe this play can be rinsed and repeated forever.

What do you think, and what plays are you going into tomorrow with?

This is because Meta will be restricting brands like HIMS from using purchase-optimized campaigns, which many are speculating is due to legal liabilities associated with HIPAA violations and the use of the Facebook Pixel, the essential ingredient to running the most profitable type of Facebook ad campaigns.

How do I know this? I run an agency that specializes in Facebook ads and I can tell you this is every FB/IG advertiser's worst nightmare. I would be in a total panic if this was happening to me.

I’ve tested running ads without purchase optimization over many years and I can tell you they are absolute dog shit for getting an ROI. Full stop.

Back to HIMS.

They are especially fucked because:

1. They have a client/patient portal that is subject to strict HIPAA requirements. These advertisers are being specifically targeted by this change.
2. They are overly reliant on Meta ads like many direct to consumer brands. Losing the ability to leverage the best optimization settings will be catastrophic to HIMS customer acquisition cost on day 1.

These changes are going into effect on January 1 and Meta is expected to officially announce it on December 5th. 

If HIMS doesn’t immediately take a hit upon this being announced then I see their Q1-Q2 earnings to look like a flatline after what will likely be their biggest Q4 ever.

I hope everyone is getting ready to talk stocks and politics at the Thanksgiving table because that's what the holiday is all about, amiright?

I for one will be talking about NVDA.

I posted earlier today around 10am-11am EST and said that NVDA was gonna stop sliding at 131-ish, since there is a good support there.

And what happened???? The turkey came home to roast

Yes, that's right - it snapped back like a rubber band into your eye. Ok, so that means that the support level that I suggested held for a 3rd time, making it very reliable.

And to add some sugar to that sweet potato pie, the stock closed up $3 from the low and a bullish pattern formed throughout the whole day - the cup and handle (""C+H"").

If you don't know what the C+H pattern looks like, go to your mom's breakfront where she keeps all the tchotchkes and the fine china and take out a tea cup. Hold it up and look at it from the side, with the cup's handle on the right side. Then look at the screenshots I uploaded. It's the same thing.

This mean stock go up.

Interesting how NVDA held at that support level and then the entire day formed a C+H pattern... Hmmm...

PLUG - and the Hydrogen sector - is primed to go up big,1h1byds,Nuts4Puts,2024-11-28 00:29:50,27,0.65,84,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h1byds/plug_and_the_hydrogen_sector_is_primed_to_go_up/,"How do you do, fellow autists? Today's DD is an older meme, but it checks out. That's right, our favorite hydrogen power play - PLUG.

PLUG Power's revenue has been growing fast over the past few years. In their most recent quarter, they reported $260 million in revenue, which is a huge jump compared to where they were just a year ago. This shows that their hydrogen tech is really starting to take off, and they're making big strides in building up their customer base.

What's even better is their gross profit is improving too. They've gone from some pretty hefty losses in the past to now getting closer to break-even. That means they're really starting to scale up. They’ve been investing heavily in R&D and infrastructure, but those costs should start paying off soon.

And here’s the kicker—PLUG is locking down major partnerships and contracts with huge players like Amazon, Walmart, and Home Depot.

Other catalysts:

1: PLUG looking to get a $1.8ish billion loan from the government

2: Possible old CEO stepping down to insert new blood.

TLDR: PLUG is primed to move.

I just like the stock and I want to talk about it.

Embraer recently hit it's highest price in the last 10 years and it comes after a disastrous failed merger with Boeing in 2020. They spent years prepping the company for the merger and were left with their dicks hanging out when Boeing backed out last minute (Broke ass Boeing didn't have the money to go thru with the acquisition). It was the best thing that could've ever happened to them. 

With a new CEO and a new direction, Embraer is setting itself up to challenge both Boeing and Airbus in the near future. They're already the third largest commercial air aircraft manufacturer in the world and their market share only increases with the higher demand from Airlines for fuel efficient aircrafts and their growing Military and private jet segments.

Embraer aircrafts will soon be 100% of American Airline's regional fleet and many other orders to come. Also, passengers absolutely love the experience of flying on an Embraer. 

Another interesting thing about Embraer is their track record on innovation. I'd recommend you guys researching and reading up on their EVE project. They're basically leading the field in the urban air mobility segment (basically taxi/uber but with planes) and it seems very promising. They are developing a small electric aircraft intended to be used for short urban travel (up to 100 KM /60 miles).

That being said, I have to confess one the biggest reasons I like ERJ is because it would be a tremendous FUCK YOU to Boeing if they stole their share of the market. ERJ stock price is already higher than Airbus although Airbus has a much larger Market Cap. But fuck them too. ERJ to the fucking moon. 

I'm absolutely new to the stock game and should not be trusted. But I do invite you guys to learn more about this company.

If one of you regards want to take a look at their Q3 returns, here is the link: https://embraer.com/global/en/news?slug=1207478-earnings-results-3rd-quarter-2024 

I also would recomend reading this interview from their CEO. He shares his vision for the future of the company and how they want to get there:https://fortune.com/2024/10/21/ceo-embraer-aerospace-company-rewrote-strategy-boeing-joint-venture-loss-francisco-gomes-neto/

$OKLO is Undervalued Relative to $SMR,1h19806,C130J_Darkstar,2024-11-27 22:36:31,136,0.85,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h19806/oklo_is_undervalued_relative_to_smr/,"It’s mind-boggling that Oklo trades at **\~37%** of NuScale’s market cap ($2.6B vs $6.9B). I strongly believe this valuation disparity will eventually correct. For context, if Oklo were valued similarly to NuScale, its share price could exceed **$58/share**.

Oklo is positioned to lead the domestic nuclear sector;

* Capital Efficiency: arguably the healthiest balance sheet amongst SMR projects, having enough cash on hand to fund through their initial builds, with a low burn rate.
* Strong Leadership: executive leadership team with PhDs, Sam Altman as chairman, and a current board member slated to lead the Energy sector (Chris Wright.) Jake and Caroline (founders) are extremely passionate about the technology and opportunity, signaling to investors that they are keeping their equity for the long haul.
* Proven Technology: EBR-II operated through decades of testing between 1964-1994 at INL, clearly demonstrating that the molten sodium fast reactor can operate reliably and efficiently overtime.
* First-mover Advantage: Aurora is on target towards 2027 deployment at INL. Oklo has had the most regulatory engagement relative to other advanced reactor projects and have hired on a lot of former NRC regulatory staff. Also, unlike their competitors, they’ve already secured fuel from the DOE for their first Aurora build.
* Commercialization Model: their ‘owner and operator’ model will allow them to scale rapidly and profitably alongside AI data centers throughout the 2030s. NRC whitepapers suggested that subsequent site reviews will take as little as 7 months, and Oklo will be able to debt finance project builds through future projected cash flows. They currently have 2.1GW in customer commitments, most notably from Equinix and Wyoming hyperscale.
* Alternative Revenue Streams: Oklo has positioned itself to benefit from other revenue sources; uranium recycling to repurpose fuel from nuclear waste reserves, and the manufacturing of radioisotopes through the recently proposed acquisition of Atomic Alchemy.

In contrast, NuScale is in a much worse position with regard to timelines:

* NuScale doesn’t have any construction or operating licenses, they only have a design certification for their 12x50MW plant. In order for their customers to obtain those licenses, it requires a 24-36 month NRC review period that **has not been initiated yet**. This is why NuScale was projecting their first builds in early 2030s, which is years behind Oklo’s 2027 target and that’s probably being optimistic (as you’ll see below).
* The reason why OKLO is so much further ahead is because they are submitting a COLA, which seeks approval for design, construction and operating, only taking them 24 months. Compare this to NuScale, where **every individual customer** needs to create and submit detailed plans, then wait 24-36 months for build and operating licenses.
* It was a strategic choice by NuScale and others to only sell designs and not be an ‘owner and operator’ like Oklo. They would have to commit to the responsibility of building and running the reactors themselves, which does come with additional hurdles and liability, but allows for **much faster** scaling.
* Putting aside those timelines, Nuscale’s 12x50MW plant was found to be **not economically viable**, so they are back to get a standard design approval for their 6x77MW plant. Considering this factor along with the licensing timelines, their 6x77MW will likely take until 2033 for customer deployment.

Looking ahead, there is significant potential for an OpenAl partnership to materialize in the wake of all the demand that we've been seeing. Sam Altman recently visited DC to pitch lawmakers on the need for multiple 5GW data centers and pushed for the NRC to further streamline SMR approvals to meet those needs. If Oklo would be able to supply just a fraction OpenAl's future energy consumption, that would translate to a massive recurring revenue stream. Combine this with the fact that they are entering a more friendly regulatory environment, especially with Chris Wright heading the DOE under the Trump administration.

**TLDR:** $SMR is far behind $OKLO in licensing timelines (by as much as 6+ years) and it does not appear to be reflected in the market. Aside from the obvious timeline advantage, Oklo stands to benefit from their capital efficiency, leadership team, first-mover advantage, commercialization model, and diversified revenue mix. If Oklo was trading at NuScale’s valuation (which I see as realistic), we’d be looking at over **$58/share**.",2024-11-27,0.9914,Positive,"['SMR', 'EBR', 'II', 'INL', 'INL', 'NRC', 'DOE', 'AI', 'NRC', 'NRC', 'OKLO', 'COLA', 'DC', 'NRC', 'SMR', 'DOE', 'TLDR', 'SMR', 'OKLO']"

Why $SPY is the Real Thanksgiving Turkey 🦃,1h190ub,Driftaren,2024-11-27 22:28:53,103,0.91,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h190ub/why_spy_is_the_real_thanksgiving_turkey/,"Alright degenerates, gather round the table because I’ve cooked up some sweet Thanksgiving DD, and no, it’s not cranberry sauce (but this could be just as saucy). Here’s the deal: Thanksgiving isn’t just about stuffing your face and awkwardly dodging Aunt Karen’s questions about why you’re ""still single""—it’s also PRIME TIME for unsolicited stock and crypto pitches at family dinners. And that, my friends, is why Black Friday is not just for TVs at 80% off, but also for **stupidly green markets.**

Here’s how it works:

1. **Family Financial Influencers™:** Grandpa brings up how he’s *still* holding Exxon since the 80s, your cousin Chad flexes his crypto portfolio (which is 90% down, but whatever), and your tech-savvy niece just learned about AI stocks and is suddenly Jim Cramer. Everyone at the table is buzzing with ""hot picks"" while passing the mashed potatoes. This is not financial advice… but it kinda is.
2. **The FOMO Catalyst:** Uncle Bob hears about ""some stock with a weird ticker"" (it’s ACHR, Bob, get with it) and thinks, “Why the hell am I not in this?” By the time the pumpkin pie rolls around, he’s downloading Robinhood. Multiply Uncle Bobs across America, and boom, retail frenzy ensues Friday morning.
3. **Markets are Closed Thursday:** This is key. People have 24 whole hours to stew in their newfound *knowledge*. By the time the market opens Friday, all that pent-up Thanksgiving YOLO energy explodes into buying pressure. Everyone’s a financial genius after 3 glasses of wine and a turkey coma.
4. **Black Friday Greenery:** You know how everyone shops like maniacs on Black Friday? Stocks are no different. This is the ""stock market doorbuster effect."" Everyone's piling into stocks like they’re $5 air fryers. And best of all, it’s also the gateway to the “Santa Claus rally.” As Christmas shopping kicks off, so might the stock market's annual tradition of going full holiday cheer mode. It’s like the market whispering, “You’ve been good this year, here’s a little green to celebrate.” 🎅📈

# My Prediction for Friday:

* **$SPY** opens green (duh): Like your drunk uncle's karaoke rendition of ""Sweet Caroline,"" it’s inevitable.
* **Tech stocks?** Probably up because Aunt Susan heard about AI once on The Today Show and now thinks it’s the key to immortality (it is).
* **Crypto?** Let’s be real—Cousin Chad is hyping Bitcoin like he’s got Satoshi on speed dial. It’s probably gonna pump harder than Grandma’s blood pressure when she finds out you brought store-bought pie.
* **Random meme stocks?** Oh yeah, because someone’s cousin brought up “that one company with the short interest that shall not be mentioned.”
* **ACHR?** $ACHR will be taking a flight (literally and figuratively) this Friday—WSB's favorite bird is ready to soar, and you degenerates are gonna love it. 🚁💸

**TL;DR:** Thanksgiving isn’t just about turkey—it’s a breeding ground for half-baked stock ideas. When Friday rolls around, we’re gonna see a tsunami of retail money hit the markets. $SPY gonna pop, and we’ll all be riding the gravy train. **To the moon or the Wendy's dumpster, GODSPEED** 🫡

*Disclaimer:* This is absolutely NOT financial advice—just a turkey-fueled theory for entertainment purposes only. If it somehow works, consider sharing some pumpkin pie and maybe a thank-you card. 🚀

I identified 3 support levels from June through September, 2 of which have been broken. The next stop is $131-ish IMO. 

Why? This level has been tested twice before and this will be the third time. The other 2 support levels have been tested 0-1 times and we're squashed like bugs. This level has more validity behind it.

In addition, the 9 RSI on the 60min chart (at the time of this writing) reads 22, which implies a stock that got the shit kicked out of it. On the daily, it's a 34. I thought this stock is in an uptrend, wild it got here. And this stock is NVDA, not to be played like a cuck. Real chutzpah it's all the way down here, if you ask me.

I think we will see a serious bounce back to test 150 over 2 weeks, which I base on absolutely nothing. But it's like a rubber band that you stretch so much that it will snap into your eye.

I would not be buying puts at this level, I'd be buying SHARES, or calls, and take a little short term heat for a big payout.

And why did I not wait to buy at this prices instead of buying at $142? 

Bc I'm an idiot and made an impulsive trade. You can't time the top or bottom and I have no doubt it will come back. But how far do I want my ass stretched to get there? 

A question we all must ask ourselves.

🏳️‍🌈 The Fruitcake Portfolio 🏳️‍🌈,1h0w1eq,EmptyRiceBowl7,2024-11-27 09:58:27,54,0.68,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h0w1eq/the_fruitcake_portfolio/,"[The Fruitcake Portfolio v.1](https://preview.redd.it/i2yojf3sfd3e1.png?width=1266&format=png&auto=webp&s=636529c7950cdddd488f20aff86f74aef67ed951)

Greetings my friends, and prepare yourselves. Join me as we learn the wey of gey.

What you see before your very eyes is an experimental portfolio I have made. No real money is involved, but essentially this is a watchlist on E\*Trade with share quantities assigned to each stock to fit my hypothetical allocations.

The purpose of this portfolio--gey.

By tilting heavily to the gey factor, we hope to realize the rawdog premium.

The core of this portfolio is Grindr (GRND). It holds a 27% allocation (I had to convince myself to not make it 30% for diversification's sake, although such is still not off the table entirely). The path of gey is risky, but potentially rewarding. Grindr holds what many consider to be somewhat of a monopoly on the LGBTQ+ dating and hookup market. Only the individual who achieves great wealth from Grindr stock can become a true Lord of the Gey.

The other stocks that makeup The Fruitcake Portfolio are stocks that one might consider to be gey-in-some-wey. In reality, this means we must invest in stocks typically designated ""women"" stocks. Now personally, I love stocks of companies whose target audience is women. Just because the product isn't some sci-fi tech robot A.I. missile etc etc, doesn't mean that it isn't a good company with amazing potential. I personally already own ELF and \[redacted\] in my real accounts. However, in this portfolio, beauty, cosmetics, and baby/household care products (diapers, etc) make up around 26% in total (17% for ELF, 9% for \[redacted\]).

Hims & Hers (HIMS) was selected for it's exposure to the men's sexual health market. They got ED pills, condoms, lube, prostate massagers, cock rings, etc. With the addition of a 10% HIMS allocation, The Fruitcake Portfolio will be on all fours, back arched, with its cheeks up in the air for exposure to the chode of this lucrative industry. In addition to HIMS, there is also a small 2% allocation to Church & Dwight (CHD), because they make Trojan condoms.

FBTC is the Fidelity BitCoin ETF. This is the only crypto play in the portfolio and makes up 10% of the portfolio.

If Warren Buffet has Coca Cola (KO), then The Fruitcake Portfolio has Starbucks (SBUX), because Starbucks is zesty, and therefore, perfectly suited, as those who regularly drink from Starbucks follow the wey of gey. Similarly, Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) is more of a growthy-value stability stock in the restaurant sector. I wanted to originally find a vegan or vegetarian stock, however those tend to fail. However, CAKE actually has been expanding its business lately with the restaurant Flower Child. Flower Child serves vegan, vegetarian, paleo dishes, and more. So yes, CAKE is a bit of a compromise pick, but I think it fulfills the requirement of gey.

There is an 11% allocation split between Victoria's Secret (VSCO), Lululemon (LULU), and Nike (NKE). Overall, this is more of a value play and a smaller weight. VSCO is the primary holding here.

Disney (DIS) and Netflix (NFLX) are tiny allocations to streaming services. Need I explain why they are perfect for The Fruitcake Portfolio? If you are a 35 year old male millennial, and you still visit Mickey Mouse every year and take pictures with Cinderella, then you are no novice to the wey of gey.

Finally, we have a tiny 1% allocation to Google (GOOG). Literally the alphabet company.

Something interesting to note is that this portfolio actually tilts very heavily into midcaps. Once ELF becomes a large cap, then things will be more balanced. I’ve considered adding a SCV as well.

\----------------

For stocks and ETFS that didn't make the cut, I had:

TSLA & FSLR: The wey of gey is partial to EVs and clean energy.

VEGN: Basically a cruelty-free S&P 500. Considered including this and removing a bunch of the large cap stocks in the portfolio.

\[redacted\]: An OTC Malaysian stock that I could probably buy through interactive broker. It's particularly NSFW.

\[redacted\]: Weed Stocks.

TGT: Target is Target.

BBWI: Bath and Bodyworks for scented candles and slippery bathtub moments--with bubbles (ofc).

RVLV: Clothing Retailer.

\----------------

If anyone has any ideas of how they might improve this portfolio, feel free to let me know. Any interesting stocks that you think might fit well in the mix? Would you swap out anything?

I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150.

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024.

Red Cat Holdings, Inc. is a technology company specializing in the development of drone systems and solutions for military and commercial applications. In response to the United States renewing bans on DJI drones through legislation such as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and the American Security Drone Act, Red Cat focuses on providing advanced, domestically produced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and related technologies. The company's products aim to enhance drone operations while addressing national security concerns by supplying secure, American-made drone solutions. Through its subsidiaries, including **Teal Drones** and **FlightWave**, Red Cat offers products that support reconnaissance, surveillance, and other critical functions, delivering innovative solutions to defense organizations and industries requiring drone capabilities[.](https://imgur.com/a/8E9PtMl)

**Investment Thesis**

Jeff Thompson, CEO of Red Cat Holdings, has outlined significant developments that position the company for substantial growth and potential undervaluation in the market. The following points highlight the company's strategic advantages and growth prospects, incorporating recent developments from the company's earnings call and industry dynamics.

# 1. Significant U.S. Army Contract

**SRR Program Win**

* **Contract Award**: Red Cat's subsidiary, **Teal Drones**, has been selected as the sole winner of the U.S. Army's **Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) program**, securing a contract to deliver **5,880 systems**. Each system includes **two drones and one controller**, amounting to a total of **11,760 drones**.
* **Contract Value**: The average price of a system is around **$45,000**, depending on configuration. This implies a base contract value of approximately **$264 million**.
* **Competitive Edge**: Teal Drones was chosen over better-funded competitors like Skydio, which has raised over **$700 million** in venture capital. Despite being an underdog, Teal's technological advancements and ability to meet the Army's stringent requirements led to this significant win.

**Additional Revenue Streams**

* **Maintenance and Support**: The contract includes provisions for repairs, training, and spare parts, which could increase the contract's value by an additional **50-70%**. Historically, programs of record have seen significant revenue from spares and support over many years.
* **Expansion Potential**: The SRR program's success positions Red Cat to secure additional contracts with other military branches, U.S. government agencies, and NATO allies.

**Program of Record Status**

* **Simplified Procurement**: Achieving **Program of Record** status streamlines the procurement process for other defense organizations, allowing them to purchase directly off the SRR contract. This designation enhances credibility and accelerates additional orders and long-term partnerships.

# 2. Anticipated Growth and Revenue Projections

**Projected Revenues**

* **Fiscal Year Projections**: The company has provided guidance of **$50-55 million** for calendar year 2025, based on the initial phases of the SRR contract.
* **Potential Upside**: With additional appropriations and the possibility of accelerated procurement, revenues could increase significantly. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes approximately **$79.5 million** in funding for the program line that supports SRR.
* **Long-Term Outlook**: Including potential additional contracts and support services, annual revenues could reach around **$100 million**, excluding new contracts.

**Future Contracts**

* **International Demand**: NATO allies and other international partners have shown strong interest in the Black Widow drone, especially after the SRR program win. Some opportunities may eclipse the SRR program in size and value.
* **Expansion into Asia-Pacific**: The company is also engaging with Asian allies, such as Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, the Philippines, and South Korea, to explore additional sales opportunities.
* **Replicator Initiative Participation**: Red Cat is involved in the Department of Defense's **Replicator program** to mass-produce affordable, autonomous drones, potentially leading to larger future contracts.

# 3. Valuation Compared to Industry Peers

**Market Valuation Discrepancy**

* **Underappreciated Value**: Despite securing a landmark contract and demonstrating significant growth potential, Red Cat's market valuation remains lower than private peers like Skydio, Anduril Industries, and Shield AI.

**Revenue Multiples**

* **Industry Comparison**: Competitors are trading at revenue multiples ranging from **18× to 28×**. For instance:
   * **Shield AI**: Trading at **18.4×** revenue.
   * **Anduril Industries**: Trading at **28×** revenue.
   * **Skydio**: Recent valuation at **$2.2 billion**, trading at **22×** revenue.
* **Red Cat's Multiple**: Based on the company's guidance, Red Cat trades at a significantly lower multiple, suggesting substantial upside potential when aligning with industry standards.

**Upside Potential**

* **Implied Valuation**: Using projected revenues of **$100 million** and applying a conservative industry revenue multiple of **20×**, Red Cat's implied market capitalization could be **$2 billion**.
* **Implied Stock Price**: With approximately **75.5 million** shares outstanding, this valuation translates to an implied stock price of approximately **$26.49** per share.
* **Potential Upside**: This represents an approximate **182% increase** from the current stock price of **$9.39**.

# 4. Strategic Capital Management

**No Immediate Capital Raise**

* **Financial Flexibility**: The company has filed a **$100 million mixed securities shelf registration**, allowing Red Cat to issue various types of securities over time. However, management has indicated **no immediate plans** to raise capital through equity offerings.
* **Utilizing Debt Instruments**: Red Cat has room on its existing debt instrument and may use this for short-term capital needs, minimizing shareholder dilution.

**Minimal Capital Raise if Needed**

* **Operational Continuity**: Any potential capital raise would be around **$10-15 million** to ensure operational efficiency without significant dilution.

**Investor Assurance**

* **Fiscal Responsibility**: CEO Jeff Thompson emphasizes a prudent approach to capital management, focusing on maximizing shareholder value and achieving cash-flow-positive operations.

# 5. Product Development and Expansion Opportunities

**Advanced Drone Focus**

* **Teal's Black Widow Drone**
   * **Technological Advancements**: The **Black Widow** is a **3-pound**, folding, backpack-size drone capable of flying autonomously without GPS, using an internal map for navigation.
   * **Electronic Warfare Resilience**: It can operate without emitting radio frequencies for up to **40 minutes**, making it less susceptible to detection and jamming—a critical advantage in modern warfare.
   * **Features**: Rugged, reliable, fully modular, quiet, long flight time and range, high-resolution cameras, stealth modes, onboard compute for AI and autonomy, capability to carry secondary payloads, and operation in electronic warfare environments.
* **Webb Controller**
   * **Innovative Design**: Teal designed the **Webb** controller from scratch in less than five months. It is now the **program of record controller** for SRR.
   * **User-Centric Features**: Easy to use, comfortable to hold, modular, supports RF silent and stealth modes, uses the same battery as the drone, simplifying logistics.
* **Manufacturing Capabilities**
   * **High-Volume Production**: Teal has designed the Black Widow and Webb for **mass production**, with the capacity to produce **hundreds of systems per month** in low-rate initial production (LRIP) and scaling to **thousands per month** by the end of next year.
   * **Scalability**: The manufacturing facility can increase output by adding shifts, including moving to two or three shifts and operating on weekends.

**Edge 130 Drone**

* **FlightWave Acquisition**: Red Cat's acquisition of FlightWave adds the **Edge 130** drone to its portfolio.
* **Order Backlog**: Over **200 orders** for the Edge 130, expected to be delivered in Q1.
* **New Facility**: The company is moving into a new factory to accommodate production needs.

**Mass Deployment Readiness**

* **Scalability**: Red Cat's drones are well-suited for large-scale deployment initiatives like the Replicator program and can meet the high demand seen in conflicts such as Ukraine.
* **Red Cat Futures Initiative**
   * **R&D Focus**: The company is pursuing research and development opportunities to integrate capabilities with strategic partners, enhancing their product offerings and addressing future mission needs.
   * **Software Ecosystem**: Plans to offer a menu of configurations and software applications for different use cases, leveraging the onboard compute power for AI and autonomy.

# 6. Increased Industry Recognition

**Media Coverage**

* **National Attention**: Red Cat and Teal Drones have received significant attention from major outlets, including features in **The Wall Street Journal**, highlighting their strategic importance and technological advancements.

**Investor Interest**

* **Market Visibility**: Heightened visibility is attracting major investment banks and potential investors, increasing the company's profile within the investment community.

**Blue UAS Listing**

* **DIU Blue UAS Refresh Challenge**: Red Cat has submitted the Black Widow and Edge 130 drones for inclusion in the Department of Defense's Blue UAS list.
* **Progress**: Both drones have passed initial testing phases and are moving into the final stage, involving review of bill of materials and cybersecurity practices.

# 7. Competitive Landscape and Industry Challenges

**Competitor Challenges**

* **Skydio's Setbacks**
   * **Operational Failures**: Skydio's drones underperformed in Ukraine, suffering from electronic warfare tactics that led to loss of control and drones going off course.

$VSH - The Forgotten King of Chips,1h0l658,BBala422,2024-11-27 01:28:59,17,0.77,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h0l658/vsh_the_forgotten_king_of_chips/,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. 

Who is $VSH?

Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY.

Why $VSH is printing money:

Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts.

Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong.

Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco.

Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. 

Recent Catalysts: 

Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming.

Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. 

Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products:
	•	GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure.
	•	RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards.
Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are.

Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money.

Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot.

Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from:
	•	Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical.
	•	IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it.

The Stock Is Still Cheap

Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued. As I said earlier, the P/E ratio is still around 12-13, compared to Nvidia’s 75+. This is a company with real earnings, real dividends, and real growth potential. This is a great opportunity to make back everything you lost from your MSTR calls.

Then on Monday, the department store chain surprised investors by revealing that those very costs had become the source of an internal investigation into what the company has described as a multimillion-dollar employee plot to manipulate the metrics.”

MSTR: Don't Mistake Leverage for Genius [DD],1h0k4ie,Virtual_Seaweed7130,2024-11-27 00:46:40,73,0.85,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h0k4ie/mstr_dont_mistake_leverage_for_genius_dd/,"Microstrategy (MSTR) has a simple strategy of using various forms of debt to buy bitcoin. Regardless of your stance on Bitcoin, it begs the question: **why** invest in Microstrategy over Bitcoin? In the words of Steve Eisman, “They mistook *leverage for genius*.”

Sure, Microstrategy is more leveraged than Bitcoin, but you can also leverage your bet on Bitcoin; take out margin, buy a leveraged instrument on an exchange, or, my favorite, taking an extra shift at Wendy's.

So, let's compare the strategy. How would you do if you just bought leveraged Bitcoin instead of Microstrategy, and mimicked their strategy? I'll walk us through returns from the bottom of the BTC bear market on December 30, 2022, until today.

On 30 December 2022, MSTR had a market capitalization of **1.63B.** They held **132,500 bitcoin** valued at $**2.19B** according to their Q4 earnings.

https://preview.redd.it/dw36tu03oa3e1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=783ed81a61bb033f974783e70fe2c51899d6325f

Bitcoin was around 16,529 on December 30 2022.

https://preview.redd.it/acmcnyhhoa3e1.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fc1f50ffa72683d4fc448fe2ef98720ace19ff9

They also had total long term debt of $2.4B.

https://preview.redd.it/k9zzwx15oa3e1.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=afa6a2fb9169bf7ec53956d8412f04af423e6316

Note, I'm excluding their current debt and assets from this, as I'm more interested in their BTC holdings vs. their long term liabilities (debt).

Importantly, their core loss-leading operating business was generating about $30M a year of EBITDA. You could easily value this at **Zero**, but a generous 20X multiple of 30M EBITDA would be valued at around \~$600M

https://preview.redd.it/rlnskdbaoa3e1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3029489eb18d94bea7955fd3313210b3a2870eb

So, you were buying a $600M operating business and $2.19B of bitcoin, minus $2.4B in debt, for 1.63B market cap.

Assuming you could just sell the operating business to cover debt and focus on the value of the bitcoin, that would be **$2.19B in bitcoin** and $**1.8B in debt**. So net assets of **390M**.

Owning 2.19B in bitcoin on 390M of net assets is about **5.6x** leverage.

If you took the same 1.63B needed to buy all of MSTR’s market cap at the time and bought bitcoin at 5.6x leverage you would own $**9.128B worth of BTC**, or about **552,241 BTC** at the December 30 2022 prices.

With BTC at 93K today, you would have turned your $1.63B into **$51.3B** if you used 5.6x leveraged BTC, a **3,106%** ROI.

How did MSTR do over the same time period?

https://preview.redd.it/cyc8kfjxoa3e1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0aac60559159b94bc2815e0bbba7ccfb7d5e5b6

Over the same duration, even with NAV premium expansion, MSTR has returned 2,452%. That's the difference between turning your 1.6B into 41B or 51B. A huge discrepancy!

TLDR; Adjusting for leverage based on MSTR’s bitcoin holdings vs debt, you would have been better off just buying leveraged bitcoin.

Here's my thinking:

* Political
   * Trump likely wants to privatize Fannie and Freddie. He looked into it his first time but the major things holding it back were capital reserves and political will.
   * With a Trump 2nd term, reducing the size of government is one of his biggest goals. In general, privatization is one of the most common ways of doing this. Given that Fannie and Freddie were taken over in 2008, this makes them a prime candidate to be re-privatized. 
   * Republicans have the power in Congress at the moment. 
* Financial
   * At the time, based on the plan and rules they would need about $275-300B in reserves. They currently have about $165B in reserves. In recent years, they generate about $25B in net income per year. While that's about a $100B gap, they can also raise capital through private and public means (private investors, issuing stock). 

Why 2026? Pure speculation from here on:

* Financial
   * In 2 years, they will be in a better capitalized position. They will likely have made about $50B more in income, thus having a total of about $215B in reserves and about a $50B gap in capitalization needed. Given their economics and situation, it could be a tempting investment for investors (particularly hedge funds). 
* Political
   * While this is in line, philosophically, with what Trump wants to do, it won't be a money saver and thus not likely a priority under say DOGE. This would be more symbolic and thus, in my thinking, is a lower priority. 
   * I'm guessing 2024-2026 will be somewhat politically turbulent. This will be the time that Trump takes his biggest swings in terms of cuts to the government since the Republicans control Congress. They will expend political capital to make controversial changes. Therefore, they will focus on their highest priority changes.
   * We have to see what happens to Congress in the 2026 elections. In recent history, Congress has changed power from one political party to another (I believe in 2008 Dems won power under Obama, but then Republicans gained power in 2010). If the Dems win back the balance of power in 2 years, there may not be the political will to privatize. The Dems will sell a fear message around housing affordability, increased costs to borrowers so that they can retain power and control over an important political tool. 

Conclusion

If I were to place odds, it feels feels like a latter-half Trump term initiative. And the best odds are only if Republicans retain power in both houses of Congress in order to pass a bill to make this happen. They're in healthy positions but a couple more years of making money will put them in a financial sweet spot for it to be supported by politicians. 

Even then, it's quite complex and likely is years in the making. But the stock will move if the possibility of privatization in the near term becomes visible. 

If Democrats take power back in Congress in 2026, this isn't a place I'd bent money. Same goes if they win the presidency in 2028. There's also a possibility that the government wants to make major changes to how these types of government-sponsored enterprises are structured, making privatization a much more complicated matter.",2024-11-26,0.9921,Positive,['DOGE']

"Kohl's (KSS) at $15 - Seriously Undervalued, Here's Why 🚀",1h0h4qx,sodeypunk,2024-11-26 22:47:58,290,0.83,240,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h0h4qx/kohls_kss_at_15_seriously_undervalued_heres_why/,"Alright, gang, hear me out. I think (Kohls) KSS is an absolute gem right now, sitting at $15. Here's the case:

1. Franchise Group tried to buy KSS at $69 per share in April 2022 💸Yeah, you read that right. Franchise Group was willing to pay $69 for Kohl's not even two years ago. The deal was rejected (major facepalm move on Kohl's part), but it gives us a benchmark for what the market thought KSS was worth. Now, let’s take a moment to think about why Franchise Group was willing to pay that much... This wasn't some random offer. Kohls has value. It's just undervalued right now.
2. Oak Street Real Estate Deal – A $2B Real Estate Portfolio 🏢After that rejection, Oak Street stepped in and made an offer to buy a portion of Kohl's real estate for $2B. Wait—$2 billion for a portion of the real estate? At the current market cap of $1.65 billion, that tells you one thing: Kohl's real estate alone is worth more than the ENTIRE company. If we’re being conservative, the real estate portfolio could easily be worth $4-5 billion, which is well above where the stock is trading right now. So, the company’s assets are massively underpriced.
3. 32% Short Interest – Don’t need to tell you guys about potential, you know the drill.
4. Seasonal Play – December to January Pop Historically, Kohl’s stock tends to do well in the December to January timeframe, often gaining around 25-30%. Worst-case scenario, you’re breaking even based on the past 5 years if you’re holding through this period, but with the setup here, I’d bet on a solid upside. Buy in December, sell in January, rinse and repeat.

TL;DR

\* Franchise Group offered $69 for Kohl's in 2022. The stock is $15 today.

\* Oak Street valued Kohl's real estate at $2B for a portion. That’s a huge asset undervaluation.

\* 32% short interest

\* December to January historically sees a 30% upside.

So, what’s the risk at $15? This stock is undervalued and has additional catalysts.

This isn’t financial advice, but this setup has ""degenerate gains"" written all over it. 🤘

Would seem to me:

1. Their revenues from trading are getting smoked down 27% last quarter?. Crypto is clearly not a ""transactional"" asset class anymore.
2. Even if stablecoin volume is huge - surely the USA is the wrong place to host such a venue/stock as the path forward for stablecoins. They say $20trillion in stable has transacted this year already - but people will not pay a premium to move money around for legimate purchases when banks/Wise/whatever do this almost for free. Theres a lot of volume as people accumulate positions - but its not clear why they would continue to use this if the platform required any meaningful fee.
3. Impossible to have much of a moat in a deregulated world (assuming #2 is wrong) in which case the trade to be long the only place in town to ""do"" crypto is pretty played out.
4. Even given all that, the company just doesn't make much money. There will be some revaluation due to their bitcoin portfolio and a flurry of MSTR vs XBT convergence trades - but beyond that its hard to see an exchange doing well where volumes are in decline.

So they trade 80x+ forward PE and even those estimates look pretty fanciful on the earnings side. So (as with MSTR) theres room to get smoked if the bull run continues in Crypto (in which case would seem being long bitcoin is better than COIN) - but **if the music pauses for a couple minutes, then surely COINs ability to collect tendies is pretty limited as people no longer really 'trade' crypto pairs - just stagnant insto/whales holding a larger and larger share of the only remaining crypto asset that matters.**",2024-11-26,0.9873,Positive,"['COIN', 'USA', 'MSTR', 'XBT', 'PE', 'MSTR', 'COIN']"

Let’s break down Kohl’s ($KSS). The stock is down 20% today, trading at an all-time low with a market cap under $2 billion. Meanwhile, the company generates $600 million in free cash flow (FCF) annually and owns $7 billion in real estate assets. with net assets of $4B.

1.The Business: Kohl’s still did $18 billion in sales for fiscal 2024, even without fully capitalizing on its Sephora partnership, which is boosting foot traffic in every store its been rolled out in (and they continue to roll out more) .

2. Valuation and Cash Flow: •	Kohl’s generated $300 million in net income last fiscal year and nearly double that in free cash flow (FCF): $600 million. Based on this quarter they’ll likely land somewhere in a similar ball park. •	Historically, Kohl’s has averaged $1 billion in FCF, meaning current results are already deeply discounted. And yet, the stock is trading at just 3x FCF. •	The discrepancy between net income and FCF comes from non-cash expenses like depreciation on their $7 billion real estate portfolio. This isn’t “money burned”—it’s accounting noise.

3. Balance Sheet Strength: •	Kohl’s has $14 billion in total assets/4B net, with a large portion being real estate. They own over 400 stores outright—hard assets that could generate significant cash in a liquidation scenario. •	Liabilities are about 11B, Yes, they exist, but Kohl’s is far from distressed, with manageable debt relative to their assets and FCF generation.

4. Short Interest: •	Over 30% of Kohl’s shares are shorted. Shorts betting on total collapse might not fully understand the cash generation and real estate value here. Any positive catalyst—a strategic pivot, real estate monetization, or improved retail sentiment.

5. CEO Departure: •	Kohl’s just announced its CEO, Tom Kingsbury, is stepping down—news that likely contributed to today’s selloff. But here’s the kicker: Kingsbury was adamant about NOT selling Kohl’s assets. His departure reopens the possibility of a real estate monetization play, which could unlock billions in value.

    •	Remember: Kohl’s rejected an $8 billion buyout offer funded by Apollo Global Management in 2022. That was four times today’s valuation.

The Bottom Line: For a $2 billion market cap, you’re buying: •	$7 billion in real estate assets (including 400+ owned stores). •	$600 million annual FCF, even in a “bad” year. •	A company that generates enough cash to pay an 11% dividend yield.

If you told me I could buy $7 billion in hard assets (4B net of liabilities) and $600 million in annual cash flow for under $2 billion, I’d say yes every time. That’s Kohl’s today. This isn’t a growth story—it’s a cash-and-assets story. You’re betting that the business, even if it declines slowly, will return far more than its current valuation. Or that someone with deep pockets will take notice and bid. Either way, this valuation is ridiculous.

Shorts, good luck.

There is currently an ongoing orange juice crisis. Here, I explain what is happening in the orange market, and what metrics/information an orange investor should look out for.

# Context: A Perfect Shitstorm of Weather and Disease

Orange juice has become very expensive. So much so, that OJ has been one of the top performers in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (excluding BTC) since 2020. Below is a graphical representation.

https://preview.redd.it/isa4u6bz273e1.png?width=1964&format=png&auto=webp&s=4351eccf9b1ea2066b8d282a3907fcc913dd41e5

*Fig 1. Orange Juice Futures (candlestick) vs. major commodities, Crude Oil (Green), Copper (Blue), Gold (Purple), Silver (Mint), Soybeans (Red).*

Since 2020, OJ has risen in price by more than 350%. This dwarfs the performance of other major commodities, some of which had arguably very good runs themselves.

So what exactly happened to OJ? There are two, both of which concern the crop’s supply side: adverse weather events and citrus greening.

First, on adverse weather: climate change is nothing new. As of late, however, the damage done to crops due to extreme weather effects seem to be on the rise both in terms of frequency and intensity. It also just happens so that Brazil was hit the hardest, recording its hottest ever temperature in 2023. This is serious news for OJ, [because Brazil alone supplies 70% of the world market](https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/29/orange-juice-makers-consider-other-fruits-prices-bananas-brazil-harvest). Needless to say, extreme heat is never good for crops - for oranges in particular, it significantly increases premature fruit drops, which diminishes yields for plantations.

*Fig 3. Brazil Change in Distribution of Average Maximum Surface Air Temperature, 1951-2020 ; source: World Bank Group. Not only has the average temperature been rising in Brazil, the extremities of droughts are also trending upwards. Extremities are the real crop killers.*

To get the absolutely worst outcome, combine this with a tree disease that has no known cure: citrus greening. Citrus greening causes citrus fruit to stay green instead of ripening, turning it bitter and inedible, and causes the trees to produce less fruit over time. Once a tree is infected, it typically dies within 5-10 years. There is currently no known cure. The disease is also highly contagious. [Virtually all trees in Florida, which used to top even Brazil in OJ production at one time, is infected by citrus greening](https://news.mongabay.com/2024/04/florida-citrus-growers-hope-push-pull-agroecology-method-will-save-their-industry/). Florida barely produces any oranges these days, and most juice makers have already left their groves (Fig 4). As for Brazil, \[Fundecitrus estimated in 2023 that 38% of the plants in the Brazilian citrus belt had symptoms of citrus greening\]([https://calfruitandveg.com/2024/01/25/citrus-greening-hlb-impacting-brazilian-citrus-crop-annual-report/#:\~:text=The citrus belt%2C however%2C also,have symptoms of the disease.)](https://calfruitandveg.com/2024/01/25/citrus-greening-hlb-impacting-brazilian-citrus-crop-annual-report/#:~:text=The%20citrus%20belt%2C%20however%2C%20also,have%20symptoms%20of%20the%20disease.)).

*Fig 4. US Domestic Production of Oranges. Florida now makes less than 1/10 of what it used to make just 20 years ago. Most citrus trees died due to citrus greening, and most grove owners never replanted.*

As a result, OJ inventory is currently at historically low levels (Fig 5, Fig 6), which explains the squeeze in its price. [USDA estimated that the 2022-2023 growing season for citrus was the least productive since 1936.](https://www.wusf.org/environment/2023-05-08/20-year-fight-citrus-greening-florida-farmers-researchers-exhausted)

# Future of Orange Juice

So where will the price of OJ be in the next few years? This is where we get into speculative territory, though the most natural response from a degen ape would be to short the hell out of this thing. Before we do so, however, let us look at some reasons why OJ will have no choice but to come down in price.

**(Somewhat) Predictable Nature of the Niño Index**

Extreme heat that damages crops in Southern Brazil (where the citrus belt is located) is almost always accompanied by El Niño. El Niño occurs when the Pacific Ocean near the equator becomes unusually warm, causing global weather disruptions like droughts in some areas and flooding in others. La Niña is the opposite pattern, where the same region of the Pacific becomes cooler than normal, also affecting weather worldwide but generally causing opposite effects in affected regions. These patterns affect the crop conditions for each country differently, based on its geographical location. For Brazil, and the citrus belt in particular, El Niño is the more serious problem, because El Niño generally brings heat while La Niña takes it away.

https://preview.redd.it/7etys2n8373e1.png?width=2498&format=png&auto=webp&s=6baeac6f66db2abbd2b3f8a236c72d8609153882

*Fig 7. Niño Index; source: Golden Gate Weather Services. Just from a glance, the index seems to closely resemble a normal distribution. Extreme events happen at lower frequencies than less extreme events, and the index oscillates between El Niño and La Niña in a predictable pattern.*

Heat was a greater contributor than citrus greening in lowering Brazil's citrus production in the 2022-2023 growing season (CitrusBR). This means that as long as we don't see another very strong El Niño in the near future, we can be assured of successful orange harvests in Brazil. Based on historical data (Fig 7), the Niño index seems to follow a normal distribution, with La Niña usually following strong El Niños. Given the fact that we just had a very strong El Niño in 2023, there seems to be a slim chance of another one happening within the next few years.

If this is true, a cooler temperature in Brazil for the next 1-3 years should increase output and put downward pressure back on the price of OJ. Strong caveat: nobody can forecast the weather with 100% accuracy. That is why I say 'somewhat'. But the math seems grounded, and nature at least mean-reverting.

**Substitution Effect**

We can also rely on macroeconomic forces to make forecasts.

OJ is not a need. It is also has many substitutes. Consumers have a variety of juices to choose from in the supermarket. If OJ is too expensive, they can easily buy apple or grapefruit juice. Moreover, [retail juice makers (e.g., coca-cola) are looking to use alternative fruits like mandarins to produce their orange juice](https://www.newsweek.com/companies-may-stop-using-oranges-make-orange-juice-1905954).

Therefore, in the long-term, even in the unlikely scenario where the citrus supply shock never recovers, high prices for OJ will drive demand down, ultimately leading to a lower price. High price is the cure for high prices for goods that have clear substitutes and are not Veblen.

**Potential Cure for Citrus Greening**

OJ can be shorted on ICE Futures. 1pt move on an OJ contract translates to a $150 P/L. Current price of OJ is 513.10. The average price of OJ pre-supply shock was approximately 130. Assuming that the current price reverts back to the mean, an investor can therefore expect to make a profit of $57,450 with a \~$20k maintenance margin per contract. The actual profit will most likely be lower, however, because of the big spreads in OJ (OJ is not a liquid contract) and rollover risk. Still, OJ presents a good opportunity for speculators at this point in time, for reasons mentioned above.

**TLDR; OJ is overpriced. Short it at your own risk.**",2024-11-26,0.9502,Positive,"['OJ', 'BTC', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'US', 'OJ', 'USDA', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'US', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'ICE', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'OJ', 'TLDR', 'OJ']"

"$CBL: The Shopping REIT that Screws Banks and Has 2-3x Upside to Comps
",1h031g7,GuitarCute,2024-11-26 09:35:07,49,0.94,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h031g7/cbl_the_shopping_reit_that_screws_banks_and_has/,"***TL;DR at Bottom for my ADHD brethren.***

CBL is playing 4D chess in the retail REIT game. Unlike the high majority retail REITS I’ve seen, it has non-recourse loans. What does that mean? It means that if a property isn’t pulling its weight, they just toss the keys back to the lender and walk away. To simplify:

1. CBL buys a property with loans (like a mortgage)
2. Property works out - CBL wins
3. Property doesn’t work out - CBL can simply walk away and the bank takes the property, but ***cannot go after other assets!*** CBL only loses what they put in (analogous to down payment... not a huge L)

This is combined with some excellent operational performance compared with peers. Depending on what comp you use, it seems like CBL could fairly be 2-3x higher in stock price. It has **better** operating metrics and ROIC:

https://preview.redd.it/cpx617lh763e1.png?width=1286&format=png&auto=webp&s=119457849d20a7ace07d57e732056d0040ab4f46

*So, if it’s so great, who owns it?*

Well, there’s 64.5% insider ownership… this is insanely high so management and insiders like Oaktree (Howard Marks) think it looks good. But this has a side effect that is negative for exposure: it also makes the float low, so institutions can’t easily buy in. But to solve this problem, CBL is using its 17% cash flow yield to buy back shares. They've nuked 8% of the float in buybacks this past year which means there is significant upward buying pressure. 

So essentially, this company has emerged from distress having offloaded shitty properties, and is now printing cash, buying back shares, and bullying lenders. There are several catalysts on the near horizon:

1. Lowered interest rates are pure fuel for this company, so if the economy shows softness, which it has, rates will come down even more and help it.
2. The company recently has had great momentum (+10% in past month) and this indicates more and more interest.
3. New buybacks likely will be announced at next earnings in Feb

*Here’s what makes it especially interesting. As far as I can tell, sh-rts were fairly lazy and just thought:*

“Hmm, this is some random shopping mall REIT, hurr durr let’s sell it. Plus, it emerged from bankruptcy, it must have had bad performance… yep hurr durr” 

This has led to 16% SI which is very significant for this sector.

If you are generally concerned with this play, I would recommend considering a pair trade by shorting one of the other, lesser performing REITs, which should get rid of most sector risk. Then you sit around and wait. Management is insanely aligned with you, the company is on fire, and it’s going to get even better if rates lower. In the meantime, you enjoy cash being thrown off and shares being bought back.

I bought calls that expire after the next FOMC, which should be a good catalyst if they lower rates. I’ve been banking so far:

You're too scared to YOLO into $MSTR. $PCT is now at a similar stage as when AsSTiTs had their first test satellite in the air or Archer first flew their eVTOL. They've shown it can work; now comes the commercialization and scaling.

PureCycle has invented a revolutionary new way to recycle plastic. Most plastic you put in the recycle bin today [gets burned or thrown away](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/california-sues-exxonmobil-plastic-recycling-deception-rcna172267). They've finally figured out a way to actually re-use this shit (recycle symbol #5) and are scaling up production and signing contrats right now, just so you can get in on the ground floor. Other brands want their product because it makes them look good to their customers that they're using recycled plastic, and it's cheaper too I'm pretty sure.

*1. The Technology*

[https://x.com/PureCycleTech/status/1857423308821795018](https://x.com/PureCycleTech/status/1857423308821795018)

These guys have been dropping corporate hype videos in recent weeks because they're finally getting cocky that their shit works. I'm honestly not exactly sure what's happening here, but it seems like the new plastic they're making in their Ohio factory is pure as hell.

[https://x.com/PureCycleTech/status/1861125793780301911](https://x.com/PureCycleTech/status/1861125793780301911)

Here's another video from today of their CEO flexing their facility in Denver which apparently sources old plastic to make the new plastic. Again not entirely sure what I'm looking at here, but [this guy is a dawg and lives for this shit](https://x.com/private_dataguy/status/1859221977551998988), which is what you want in a CEO. My takeaway is they finally are getting quality old plastic to make into elite new plastic, at scale.

They also have a sick new R&D facility in North Carolina to learn how to keep churning out purer and purer product.

*2. Commercial Demand*

This tech was actually made by P&G and licensed to PureCycle to scale. P&G is their first customer. In addition, [according to their 10-Q](https://ir.purecycle.com/sec-filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000950170-24-127556/0000950170-24-127556.pdf), ""PureCycle has allocated 40% of the Augusta Facility output, for Lines 1 and 2, to existing customers and expects that additional offtake agreements will continue to be negotiated."" I'm pretty sure that means that for their second factory in Georgia, they already have 40% of sales made and are actively working on the rest.

Now that the tech works, their focus this year and Q1/Q2 2025 is commercialization. This is the time to get in, because once they announce those juicy contracts, this thing is gone.

To be clear, this is a risky pre-revenue growth company so scaling is not guaranteed. However, it finally seems to be de-risked enough from a technology standpoint, and the deals they're making now show this.

*3. Financials*

[Their ex-CFO said they were modeling their profit margins to be 40-60%.](https://x.com/private_dataguy/status/1859221977551998988) They're taking shit that people don't want and would actually pay to get rid of and making it useful. They still may need to raise more shares to fund all their build out.

Short interest is high but the price is on an up trend. They will eventually need to cover.

🔋 Bloom Energy’s 95% Run: The Hidden Energy Play Behind AI Data Centers,1gzxx4g,AlfrescoDog,2024-11-26 05:24:42,34,0.9,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gzxx4g/bloom_energys_95_run_the_hidden_energy_play/,"**Bloom Energy (BE) surged 59% on Nov 15 and is now up 95%.**  
While it’s unclear if the rally will pause or continue—and you should be mindful that, as I just said, she has already soared 95%—this post explores why this move is more than a short-term trend, with highly significant catalysts on the horizon.

[Bloom Energy servers](https://preview.redd.it/j6j1akk2x43e1.jpg?width=3912&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb781f61de55753b16b0ff00433654d603615d53)

AI is booming, and it’s not a fad. Have you heard of NVDA? Of course you have, and you know the demand for its semiconductors is insane. Here are key insights from last Wednesday’s NVDA earnings call:

* Hopper demand is exceptional.
* Blackwell demand is staggering.
* NVDA is racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand.
* The next wave of AI is Enterprise AI and Industrial AI.

\-----

AI isn’t just the future—it’s here and scaling rapidly. These semiconductors are being used to build advanced data centers. **But to turn on these data centers, you cannot just plug all that processing power into the wall outlet. They require specialized power setups from their local energy utility.**

Connecting a data center to the grid requires major upgrades due to their immense energy demands and need for reliability:

**Dedicated Substations:** Data centers need substations with high-capacity transformers and switchgear to step down grid power. Building or upgrading a substation can take 2–3 years due to permitting, engineering, and construction delays.

**Transmission Line Upgrades:** High-voltage lines may need new installations, conductor upgrades, or pole reinforcements, often delayed by land acquisition, environmental reviews, and public opposition.

**Distribution Network Enhancements:** Local networks require upgrades like redundant feeders, voltage regulators, and new lines to ensure stable delivery from substations to data centers.

**Redundancy and Reliability:** To meet 99.999% uptime demands, utilities need to build costly redundant systems, including backup transmission lines and ring configurations, to eliminate single points of failure.

Furthermore, data centers consume immense amounts of electricity, often beyond what utilities can supply. Slow by nature, utilities are vastly unprepared for the AI-driven demand surge, and they are struggling to respond.

Besides, upgrading grid infrastructure requires billions of dollars and takes years, with delays from zoning, public consultations, and environmental reviews. As a result, companies that want to develop their data centers face growing waiting lists for power, risking their competitive edge in an industry where delays of even months can be critical.

**This isn’t hypothetical—it’s happening now.** I’ve included several sources and citations at the end.

\-----

Enter Bloom Energy ($BE), which sells on-site power generators that can run data centers **without relying on the grid**—a proven solution used for years in hospitals, factories, and off-grid installations.

On Nov 14 (after-hours), American Electric Power (AEP), a major utility that operates in 11 states and is struggling to meet data center energy demands, struck a deal with Bloom Energy. Instead of making clients wait years or relocate, AEP will offer Bloom’s energy servers, enabling data centers to power up in months, not years, and stay competitive.

This is a game-changer for Bloom Energy. They’ve shifted from selling servers to individual clients to partnering with utility giant AEP—a move from retail to wholesale.

Bloom’s technology isn’t new, but the AEP deal marks a leap to scalable, utility-scale partnerships, unlocking massive demand.

\-----

A company wanting to develop a data center: “I need energy for my data center!”  
AEP: “We’ll be able to accommodate you until mid-2027. You can wait, move to a location where the grid is already upgraded (but you need to hurry because those spaces are limited), or we can install these Bloom Energy servers and you’ll have your energy in 90 days.”

For those who grasp this jump from retail to wholesale, the opportunity is clear.  
Careful, though. My entry was over a week ago, and she has been running a lot already. However, every new AEP order or, fingers crossed, any other major utility signing a new agreement with Bloom Energy? Wink emoji.

Do your own research, though. And for those who want to dive deeper into the details, here are the sources I used to inform my play:

[AEP press release](https://www.aep.com/news/releases/read/9866/AEP-Leveraging-Fuel-Cell-Technology-to-Power-Data-Center-Growth)  
[McKinsey report on how data centers and AI rely on the availability of electric power](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-capital/our-insights/how-data-centers-and-the-energy-sector-can-sate-ais-hunger-for-power)

[Bloom Energy & AI data centers](https://youtu.be/mzg301k0SDY)

Personally, I’m playing with shares ($18.24, and I'm posting now because I was BanBet-banned last week).  
And again, she could keep running north, but be careful. However, this stock is something you should keep on a watchlist.

Zeta is also making significant investments in their sales team for 2025, which is a smart move given the $64 billion U.S. market opportunity. Executives buying $3 million worth of stock is another strong signal that leadership has confidence in the company’s future.

1. They do split it. Google goes about it's business making billions and now Chrome belongs to someone else or in its own thing. Google can just launch a new browser off Chromium open source project. Heck even if somehow they are forbidden from ever launching a browser again they can get away influencing the Chrome foundation or whatever like they've done with Mozilla through partnership/donations. It's not like their core business is Chrome anyways. Same deal goes with Android they can fork or influence even post split. Maybe if they took YouTube they'd be hit badly but still carry on making dough off search alone.

I think I bought a very bad leap contract, that cost me almost half of the security price hence my leverage is less than 2x on these leaps. Now I wonder what should I do with it. Initially I was planing to just exercise it if RKLB mooned. Well, it’s already mooned. But when I do math it seems that I will gain more shares if I sell leaps and just buy stocks on all proceeds plus money required to exercise it. 

Here is math:
Sell leaps for 7k and buy ~306 shares at current price (23$). Buy another 120 shares @23$ for additional 2800$ that would have been required to exercise these leaps. In the end, I will have 426 shares instead of 400 if I were just to exercise these options for the same extra 2800$. Does it make sense?

RedCat is an American Drone company that, as of last week, has been chosen as the sole provider of small, rucksack portable, attritable drones bringing surveillance and strike capabilities, to none other than the United States Army. 

Through a program of record initiated 5 years ago, Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR), the US Army was able to test, research, evaluate and compare capabilities/limitations of drones from 37 companies including Boeing, Lockheed Martin and the “reigning champion” from SRR tranche 1, Skydio. They also fielded these drones in Ukraine to determine resistance to electronic warfare and signal jamming in combat against a modernized and “competent” near peer adversary. Needless to say, RedCat provided a far superior drone, purpose built for the warfighter and was subsequently chosen as the contract winner. 

“Oh it’s one little Army contract for around 12,000 drones, how is that important?”

Great question, looks like not everyone in this sub rides the short bus to school. 

As mentioned previously, SRR testing began in 2018. Now who was paying attention to something other than the big red line that was your portfolio in 2022? Just 4 years after the Army identified the potential viability of drones in wartime? Yep, you got it. Russia invaded Ukraine. Here’s a sticker for you to add to your helmet. If you haven't been watching the drone footage from the Ukrainian war, you should probably get on that. 

Drones have completely changed the battlefield. Ukrainian forces are currently using/losing at LEAST 10,000 drones a month, with some 30,000+ drones in the air everyday. To reiterate, 5 years ago, before Russia invaded Ukraine, before drones were proven in combat, before Ukraine was burning through 10,000 a month to fight one of our near peers, the Army decided they would like about 12,000. 

Do the math. Do you believe the largest and most powerful land force on Earth would order 2 weeks worth of drones and call it good? You know the answer to this question. Why don’t you have free medical care? Why do you have 100k in student loans? Why will an ambulance ride bankrupt you?

Fantastic, you’re right again. 13.3% of the US Federal budget goes straight to the DOD. A cool $820 billion. I’m sure you’re losing focus but I’m certain your wife’s boyfriend can keep her company for a little bit longer. Now add this one up. If you are engaged in conflict with another world power, where do you want to put your money? Do you want to buy the 50k drone that can target anything from the sky, completely unmanned, or do you want to spend 10 million on a single M1 Abrams tank that will take a critical hit from an FPV attack drone, killing the entire crew? 

Let me say this another way. You are America and will stop at nothing to maintain your position as the superior global superpower. Are you buying 5 tanks or 1,000 drones? 1,300 drones or a single F-18? 13,000 drones or 10 F-18’s? How about raising taxes and buying both.

I am not the Secretary of Defense but I can assume an intricate cost benefit analysis is being conducted by US military leadership. In the very near future, the DOD will be acquiring more than 12,000 drones, a whole lot more. 

In case you aren’t aware, the US Army is America’s largest branch of the armed forces. This means they have more money to R&D than their counterparts. With some second level thinking you can understand this to mean if another branch of the military can wait for a wealthier branch to spend millions/billions finding the best product, and buy it after they do, they’ll do exactly that. This reality extends beyond the American DOD. 

How about Australia? Here’s a start. 

https://ir.redcatholdings.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/158/red-cat-to-supply-flightwave-edge-130-blue-systems-to-royal-australian-navy

“Red Cat to Supply FlightWave Edge 130 Blue Systems to Royal Australian Navy”

I hypothesize allied armed forces have been patiently awaiting the conclusion of big Army’s testing to determine where they will also be sourcing their combat drones. SRR is really only the beginning. 

For those interested in semiconductor plays that also understand the importance of Taiwan, you might want to give these articles a read. 

https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2024-09/news/us-supply-taiwan-attack-drones

https://news.usni.org/2024/07/01/hellscape-swarms-could-be-as-cost-effective-taiwan-defense-says-report

The future of warfare is unmanned systems fighting other unmanned systems. Why did we leave Vietnam? Unpopularity back home, moms had enough of losing their sons. How long can America sustain a war outspending USD? When America’s cost of war is cheap drones instead of billions and American lives, we might just deter our adversaries in a way they don’t want to engage us anyways. 

That leads me to the next point. Drones as a deterrence factor. How many drones operating autonomously in a swarm is enough? How many does the entire DOD need on hand? How many do our allies want? 100,000? 200,000? A million? How many combat drones do you speculate that America’s military industrial complex wants on hand? I can’t give you a definitive answer so unfortunately you’ll have to take a quick break from licking that window and use your own reasoning skills. I can say, however, that I’m pretty confident about where they will be sourcing these drones.

Now, enough “market” analysis. Let’s talk about some numbers. u/CynicalMelody was kind enough to post this on a previous post of mine the other day.

“Here is my prediction Stock Price Potential Based on Updated Calculations
Current Market Capitalization: $708.997 million

Current Stock Price: $9.39

Shares Outstanding: Approximately 75.5 million

Projected Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue: $100 million

Industry Revenue Multiple: 20× annual revenue

Implied Valuation:

Implied Market Capitalization: $100 million × 20 = $2 billion

Implied Stock Price: $2 billion / 75.5 million shares = Approximately $26.49 per share

Potential Upside: (($26.49 - $9.39) / $9.39) × 100% = Approximately 182% increase”

This analysis does not include what will be awarded in the future. 

The stock market is forward looking. Now look forward so you can get an edge. The US drone industry is currently estimated to be worth around 3.94B, expected to increase to 8.65B by 2034. 

https://www.precedenceresearch.com/military-drones-market#:~:text=Military%20Drones%20Market%20Size%2C%20Share,7.95%25%20between%202024%20and%202034

Sure maybe the American drone industry will only double over the next 10 years, the thing is, all bets are off if/when we go to war. Where will that money go? 

If you believe global tensions are rising and war is imminent, where is your capital going to be safest? This is your opportunity to build some conviction. How will the US stock market hold up if we go to war? Individual companies? How about if we don’t? Answer those same questions but with RedCat. We get sucked in and large scale war begins, VOO -25%, RCAT +60%. Place your bets.

By current business prospects, RCAT is criminally undervalued. It should have traded at $12 the moment the SRR winner was announced. Also, is there a more reliable source of consistent payments/business than providing services to the US military/government?

This image was not my work, but here is some price modeling data.



If you can buy cheaper than $12, you’re getting a deal. If you understand the gravity of the SRR win, there is much more to follow. This is a chance to buy something that you would hold for a year. Most of yall have never heard the word “profits” so taxes isn’t a problem for you, but for the 6 people in here that aren’t regarded, this is a play you can hold for a year and pay long term capital gains on your gains. Buy calls, exercise them or sell them, buy shares keep them, whatever you wanna do. This company is promising with a bright future. I do apologize that I didn’t post this earlier. I have been working with the mods to get this posted as soon as it was allowed. (Until a few days ago it’s been under 500M market cap. Wanted and tried to post DD back in July)

Archer (ACHR): Over $6 and Counting—The Journey is Far from Over 🚀,1gzis0t,joprax,2024-11-25 18:56:56,677,0.94,269,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gzis0t/archer_achr_over_6_and_countingthe_journey_is_far/,"**Alright everbody, let’s talk about where we’re at with ACHR:**

Since my first post back in October, Archer has climbed **over 100%** and now sits above **$6**. The steep incline has been exciting, but the journey is far from over. Here’s a look at what’s been happening. We’ve got major news, strong forecasts, and institutional backing that keep this play looking solid. Let me break it down:

**Analyst Price Target are Bullish**  
Analysts are projecting an **average price target of $9.69,** with some forecasts reaching as high as **$13.12**. New coverage from Needham just slapped a **Buy** rating on it. The trajectory? Upward.

**381 Funds are on Board**  
Institutional interest in ACHR is growing, with **381 funds** now holding positions—up 8.55% last quarter. Total shares owned by institutions increased by over **10%**, showing confidence in Archer’s growth. Big money sees the potential.

**Insider Activity & Growing Buzz**  
Insider transactions over the past 12 months show strong confidence from within the company:

* **7 insider buys** totaling **28.7M shares**, with only **3 sells** amounting to **3.2M shares**.
* In the last 6 months alone, there were **3 insider buys** totaling over **20M shares**.

This aligns with the momentum we’ve seen recently, with a flood of news, analyst ratings, and community discussions driving ACHR into the spotlight. The buzz isn’t just from the outside, people on the inside clearly see the potential too.

**Major NYC News**  
Archer’s partner **Skyports Infrastructure** and **Groupe ADP** have been selected to operate the **Downtown Manhattan Heliport**, a key move toward bringing electric air taxis to NYC. Together with **United Airlines**, the plan is to electrify the heliport and introduce quieter, cleaner, and more affordable urban air mobility for New Yorkers. This is a massive step forward.

**Global Expansion & Commercialization Strategy**  
Archer’s plans go beyond the U.S., they’re actively positioning themselves for deployment in the **Middle East, Asia, and India**, with key partnerships already in place. Their three-step commercialization strategy is set to begin as early as next year:

1. **Piloted demonstration flights** in key markets.
2. **Market survey trips** carrying passengers on initial air taxi routes.
3. **Full-scale commercial operations** post-certification.

India, with its large urban markets, is shaping up to be one of Archer’s biggest opportunities, supported by their partnership with **InterGlobe Enterprises**.

**Production Facility Nearing Completion**  
Archer’s new manufacturing facility is set to open in the coming weeks. This factory will begin producing **type-design aircraft** next year, ramping up to a production rate of **two aircraft per month by the end of 2025**, with plans to scale even further in 2026. This marks a significant step toward real-world operations and commercial readiness.

**The Journey Continues**  
For those already in, congrats on riding this wave. For those still watching, it’s not too late. After such a strong climb, while some might expect a pullback, in my view, consolidations aren’t guaranteed. Momentum has been holding steady, and the recent news flow has only strengthened the outlook. Even if there are minor dips, there’s no reason to get nervous. Let the doubters and short sellers be the ones sweating it out and reaching for the aspirin. With upcoming milestones like pilot flights and the manufacturing facility launch, the **short-term** and **long-term** potential both look strong.

**TL;DR:** ACHR is up over 100% but still has room to run. NYC, institutional backing, and bullish price targets are lining up to make this a big winner. The ride isn’t over yet, join if you’re ready to see what’s next. 🚀

Wishing everyone a great Thanksgiving and hoping for some gains this week to cover an extra turkey or two! 🦃

So some people have asked what’s the bull case or where Redwire has to grow. Below is a cumulative list in no particular order of my opinion. I’ve been in as low as $4, sold a fair share mid 7s but then loaded up in the $8 when I realized it wasn’t going down again and haven’t sold a share since then. I’ve done the same with rocket lab and this company is another sleeping monster. 
Again I fully feel it’s better to dca or at least do low level limit orders in order to not drive the price too high too fast. (I’m still dcaing at almost 14,000 shares) Note if you’re trying to get in I highly recommend you get what you can prior to Trump signing executive orders. No you don’t need to load up all in one day but stress manufacturing in space will be a priority for the Trump administration. 

1. Pilbox- market for it just in the pilboxes alone and as well as royalties from the crystals grown and other experiments within it. HIV market is alone 34 billion TAM. Bristol myers and eli lilly are two companies we partnered with and they are one of the heavy leaders in that field. Could expect millions annually if drug crystals grown in space show the purity levels that the chemists expect. Multiple avenues here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VttNK2UuY_w

2A. 3D bio printing- Goal is for organs which could be 7-10 years away pending how these next experiments go. Ultimate goal is manufacturing a full heart which costs 2 million alone for a donated heart (check the amount on the waiting list to receive a heart) over 3,000. Even 300 hearts a year you’re looking at over $600 million a year(I imagine a heart tailored to not be rejected would cost maybe 5-10 million)There are other applications they are trying to pursue as well with their 3d bio printing.(Knee, valves, heart patches etc) 

2B. They could potentialy grow human tissues for drug and cosmetic testing, which could in turn render animal testing obsolete. That's great news for the animals, but on a financial note this could be huge, as it could accelerate bringing drugs to market as one important and costly development step could be skipped by going straight to human testing on printed tissues.

2C. Microgravity research and manufacturing includes semiconductors, agricultural, life support, etc https://redwirespace.com/newsroom/new-redwire-investigations-launching-on-spx-31-include-crystallization-and-plant-experiments-to-improve-life-on-earth-and-expand-humanitys-presence-in-space/

3. VLEO- look up darpa with their otter program. Phase four, epl and redwire has been awarded contracts for this. Phase Four and Redwire received the most. Budget from DARPA for this year is 25 million, 2025 increased to -62 million with 2026 expected to be increased two fold again as we will be getting into the operation phase. For Europe we have SKIMSAT and Phantom. 

4. Valkyrie Hall effect thrusters - Huge market for this. Redwire partnering with Phase Four on the developing of these…multiple applications. Full rate production starting 2025.

5. Link 16 - Redwire has the best link 16 antennas on the market. Even though there are some issues the FCC has, link 16 is too important for national security to pull away from. This market will only be increasing. https://redwirespace.com/newsroom/sda-completes-another-major-link-16-testing-milestone-with-successful-space-to-ship-demonstration/Currently subcontracted by York Space Systems and Rocket Lab.

6. Overseas market - I see some huge potential with Dubai and some other European markets. Redwire recently won a contract/grant from ESA for robotic arm development. 

7. Redwires software line- not just hardware but they provide software to nasa and other space agencies. Veritrek for thermal analysis and ACORN for digital engineering. 

8. Roll out solar arrays (ROSA) - Astrobotic’s Lunar Vertical Solar Array Technology program to deliver power on the lunar surface. 8 ROSA Thales Alina Space has put ROSA on their GEO satellites as a baseline option, Blue Ring strategic partner, we have 25 orders as of September 2024.

9. SDA contracting- potential for trache 3 awards but at the very least will receive subcontracting work for their antenna line. Rocket Lab selected them as a subcontractor for their antennas which with how rocket lab is all about doing their own research/work, has shown how far ahead redwire is in this antenna tech and has imo given up the fight in this market. 

10. Their Robust camera line for both lunar/orbit, sun sensors/star trackers(Most of recent award for next generation interceptor program)

11. Fablab https://redwirespace.com/newsroom/redwire-wins-nasa-contract-to-advance-new-in-space-manufacturing-capability-for-journeys-to-moon-mars-and-beyond/

12. Developed systems to build landing pads, roads and other forms of infrastructure on the moon. 

13. Management looking after shareholder value.  CEO by the books alone has made it clear that they aren’t trying to flood the market with shares. CEO currently holds about 143,000 shares. The board/CEO is very tight with their wallet when it comes to share issuance.

MSTR Has An Infinite Money Glitch,1gzerax,chuck_portis,2024-11-25 14:36:01,840,0.86,320,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gzerax/mstr_has_an_infinite_money_glitch/,"Sorry if someone already talked about how this really works. But let's get into the details here on why MSTR is able to get 0% loans on billions every time they do a debt offering. Many people are wondering what kind of morons are buying 0% convertible notes from MSTR. After all, there is a reasonable chance MSTR goes bankrupt if BTC has a sustained bear market around the time these notes mature. And a company like this, you'd expect double digit interest on a loan.

But of course, these are convertible notes. The most recent offering is convertible at \~$670 per share if my napkin math is correct. So they are essentially a 0% loan with a free $670 2028 call option. It turns out, that call option is incredibly valuable. Don't take my word for it, just check the market.

According to Yahoo Finance, a $700 MSTR Jan-2027 call traded around $230-240 on Friday. A Jan-2026 $700 call traded around $185. So you'd expect a 2028 $700 call should be worth nearly $300. So just by buying the note, you're getting about $300 worth of call options per share. You can instantly hedge this position by selling the 2027 call and grabbing $240. This sets up the following scenarios...

1. MSTR goes above $700, your call buyer exercises, you convert your debt to equity to cover the exercise, you net $700 per share + $230 call, you are out the $670/share you used from your principal to convert. You have a gain of $260 on $670 initial for a profit of 38.8%, which takes a maximum of 3 years (expiry of the call option) to materialize.
2. Your call buyer never exercises, you hold through to expiry, you now have your initial investment & keep the full option premium you sold @ $230 per share. You still have 1y+ until your convertible note expires, meaning you can potentially sell another call for added ROI. You pocket $230 for every $670 invested for a gain of 34.3% in 3 years. Eventually the note matures and you get back your initial investment, MSTR is not bankrupt.
3. MSTR goes tits up sometime around 2028. You get to keep the option premium you sold of course, and you will probably recover something from the bankruptcy as well being an unsecured creditor, unless BTC goes to below 10K or something. You'd expect to get back 50-100% of your initial investment with the loan and option premium.

With this in mind, all you need to do is assign probabilities to each outcome. Clearly the financial world thinks that these are a good play. They are able to do this because the IV on their stock is absolutely bananas. This makes their call options incredibly valuable. MSTR is trading volatility for cash. And people are lining up to participate.

So long as the stock remains volatile, which seems likely, they can keep issuing more of these notes and people will be lining around the block to buy them. Meanwhile, they are using the cash to buy BTC which puts huge upward pressure on the market, and subsequently pumps their stock, and creates even more demand for their notes.

Does this end poorly? Probably. But for now the music is playing, and we all have to dance.",2024-11-25,0.9943,Positive,"['MSTR', 'MSTR', 'MSTR', 'BTC', 'MSTR', 'MSTR', 'ROI', 'MSTR', 'MSTR', 'BTC', 'IV', 'MSTR', 'BTC']"

When I posted about SMR a week or two ago several people said that it was a bad investment as it has already grown 600+ percent this year. Look at where the stock is now. After recent statements by the upcoming USA administration I think I have seen more tickers with potential to have short term gains as well as long plays. 

SMR has recently hit 30 dollars and will continue to peak I believe around 33 as a resistance after watching its chart for sometime. I believed that it would drop in price so I sold my positions at 27 dollars hoping to repurchase at 24. It is still at 28. I am going to go in with calls on this one. I believe it will increase in price steadily with sharp early market peaks. Pay attention to the volume.  If you can scalp a cheap mid jan put at a reasonable 20 something dollar range I believe it will be wise. People will be fearful of the oil energy bro in office but the dude is pro nuclear. 

The bitcoin talk about us being the capital is real. Thats why these shitcoins scammers are at an all time high look at tiktok and look at instagram reels. The normies believe this is their entry to crypto but XMR x UDC collab will most likely happen in the next 2 years so get ready for that one. BitCoin == next gold for backing the XDR == cash dollar. If trump wants to mine collect and purchase bitcoin this will innevitably be NuScales in for the government contracts as in its already its baby. UEC is still a play in the fact that it will continue to go up. Most likely based off my analysis it will hit 9.35 by christmas and hit an 8$-7.87 price point before the administration takes charge. Domestic production is back and that applies to UEC who is making moves with plans they cant share with you right now.

MSTR is like 4x bitcoin which means its going to explode up or down with price. I think the silkroad is going to comeback and take its toll on bitcoins value. When trump is talking about making us the capital for crypto that means the complete end of crypto privacy. Not everyone was busted. Drug dealers, cartels, government bribes, and illegal deals. They are all apart of its rise and its current holdings. They will sell off before the boom causing a tanking of MSTR's price. I too believe short term it will explode in value in the ROCKET direction. But normies buying at 87k 90k 95k will have a mass sell off as well when it hits 110-115k as that is a logical smooth brain move to buy a house.  They don't care about cycles or the bitcoin rainbow. 

  
This isn't a scam or a self plug. Everything I am saying is what I am going to play and not financial advice. But I would love to have a discussion with you guys while I play dota. IDK if I can link the the stream or not but I will be looking at charts and going over stories between matches and during games and death debating these plays. I have a lot to say about gold and a few recent success stories to show for my DD. Just let me know and Ill tell you my username so we can talk about these moves.

>We are moving PalantirTech to Nasdaq because it will force billions in ETF buying and deliver 'tendies' to our retail investors. Player haters be aware that we've been hated for decades (plural). Everything we do is to reward and support our retail diamondhands following.

Immediately afterwards, he deleted his tweet.

At first glance, the statement seems harmless, and even obvious. Companies are added/removed from passive indexes every day, and it's not a crime to want to deliver shareholder returns. There's no problem with boasting about passive index inclusion. It doesn't affect the fundamental business anyway.

Right?

I think otherwise.

Alex Moore said Palantir's quiet part out loud. I contend that this has been Palantir's gameplan since day one. **The stock's performance**, ridiculous valuation, and mania all **points back to one fundamental goal** of the company's management: **manipulating stock market indexes to juice valuation and provide liquidity for insider selling.**

**The Evidence (s/o Mike Green):**

**Part 1: The Listing**

Companies generally list via a direct listing, traditional IPO, or SPAC. For a company the size of PLTR, a SPAC was out of the question. They had to choose between an IPO and direct listing. Let's take a look at both.

**Traditional IPO**: Typically involves investment banks underwriting the deal, setting a price, and selling shares to institutional investors like mutual funds or hedge funds. Importantly, these shares are **not** part of the stock's free float, and insiders must dilute themselves in order to create new shares to sell on the public market.

**Direct Listing**: In a direct listing, a company offers existing shares directly to the public without issuing new shares or raising capital. This avoids traditional IPO underwriters (investment bank). The free float is immediately determined by shares held by insiders available to sell. Palantir chose this route.

**Takeaway:** In a **direct listing**, all existing shares held by insiders, employees, and early investors become eligible for public trading immediately. There is **no lock-up period** (common in traditional IPOs, where insiders are restricted from selling shares for 6–12 months). This approach ensures a **larger float** right from the start, as insiders can sell their shares directly on the public market if they choose, increasing the number of shares available for trading.

Why is this important?

Palantir almost immediately qualified for index inclusion upon its first day of listing. Vanguard and others were forced to buy shares on the **first week** of listing because Palantir met the necessary requirements for most broad market indexes:

1. Market Cap - This is self explanatory, Palantir began listing at \~17B market cap, rendering it eligible for most indexes.
2. Free Float - Indexes are not just weighted by a company's market cap. The S&P500, for example, uses **Float-Adjusted Market Cap**, adjusting the company’s market capitalization based on its free float to determine its weight in the index. Float-Adjusted Market Cap=Share Price×Free Float Shares
3. Liquidity - Also a no brainer, considering the number of shares immediately available for the public, and the hype around the stock.

It doesn't take a genius to see it. As insiders sell shares, the “effective float” rose, requiring extra purchases from index providers, and helping Palantir insiders exit.

[Vanguard = Liquidity ](https://preview.redd.it/630t26f5vy2e1.jpg?width=801&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b54299e2988d9b42437fe9eb7d9db3f407cf904b)

**Part 2: Buying a Seat at the Table**

2021-2022 was tough for Palantir. The index game was faltering as net income and revenue growth lagged. This threatened their ultimate goal of S&P500 + Nasdaq 100 inclusion. They had the market cap, if they could only find a way to juice their revenue in a profitable way to get themselves over the inclusion requirements!

So, they did what any reasonable company in this situation would do, and bought customers. Financing customer growth by [investing roughly $450MM in over two dozen SPACs](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-29/palantir-failed-to-spot-pattern-in-spac-debacle), Palantir was basically [buying revenue.](https://www.newcomer.co/p/is-palantir-buying-revenue)

The process was straightforward:

1. PLTR would invest in the SPAC and assume a significant controlling interest
2. PLTR would use the SPAC's funds to purchase PLTR services
3. Any operating losses of the SPAC company could be carefully hidden from PLTR's reporting.

[Not part of operating income!](https://preview.redd.it/ydfikqj6vy2e1.jpg?width=1254&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19a6a7d123b4cf926e5dd07b1ce374ac30061bb2)

And, soon enough, PLTR was (technically) reporting profitability by GAAP standards! With the company now profitable, in 2024 it became eligible for SP500 inclusion, and was included in September 2024, coinciding with a face-melting rally.

**Part 3: The Next Frontier**

To wind out its strategy, Palantir wants to maximize the benefits of index inclusion, capped off by its **relisting to Nasdaq** to position itself for entry into the Nasdaq-100 (QQQ).

The timing of the move is also suspect. The index’s modified market cap weighting system limits the concentration of its top three constituents, disproportionately favoring mid-tier companies ranked between #10 and #30 in market cap—exactly where Palantir has maneuvered itself.

This move is no coincidence. Palantir’s ownership by the big three institutional investors—Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street—has soared to an impressive **22.23%**, surpassing even tech giants like **Microsoft (20.5%)**, **Apple (20.0%)**, and **NVIDIA (20.17%)**. For a company that only went public in Q4-2020, this level of institutional backing is ridiculous for a company of this size.

And the insiders? They're loving the exit liquidity.

https://preview.redd.it/2ovaqp09vy2e1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c9e88a0d96b9b0e6402d50835979bd1d34530e2

In fact, they've been dumping into the institutions (and retail) this whole time:

https://preview.redd.it/2p4k1qx7vy2e1.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b0be708d61438cdcf2e779d1216cd3e9696140a

""Show me the incentive, and I will tell you the outcome.""

Institutional shareholders through indexes are the easiest exit liquidity in the world for insiders. They're brainless, rules-based buyers. And, once the entire world owns an equal share of your company, priced at 50x sales, and you've dumped most of your shares, you could give a fuck less what the market ultimately does with your stock!

Of course, index inclusion for this stock has coincided with a complete disconnect from the fundamentals. The net \~3B of projected inflows from the QQQ have contributed about 40-50B of market cap growth in just the past few weeks.

Overall, I think there's huge problems with how companies are intentionally trying to juice themselves into indexes, knowing it's full of bloat and thoughtless exit liquidity. PLTR is just one of many, and they're giving a master class in index manipulation as we speak.

TL;DR: The recent PLTR tweet about joining the QQQ was a deeper insight into strategic yet dubious decisions the company has made for years in order to increase institutional ownership to fund insider selling and pump the stock outside of business fundamentals.",2024-11-25,0.9961,Positive,"['PLTR', 'ETF', 'IPO', 'SPAC', 'PLTR', 'SPAC', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'PLTR', 'SPAC', 'PLTR', 'SPAC', 'PLTR', 'SPAC', 'PLTR', 'PLTR', 'GAAP', 'QQQ', 'QQQ', 'PLTR', 'TL', 'DR', 'PLTR', 'QQQ']"

$MARA DD - The MaraStrategy 💊,1gz8ajy,BrayFlex,2024-11-25 07:50:12,201,0.85,182,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gz8ajy/mara_dd_the_marastrategy/,"📢Preface

Disclaimer: I use a cringe amount of emoji 🫣 also the following is not not financial advice. If you lose money that's too bad, you gain a life lesson.

Illiterate? => Scroll to the bottom, follow instructions 👇

Disclosure: As of Nov 22nd I have \~8k in various $MARA calls + some additional funds to buy $MARA stock on dips. I will instantly buy more if Fred Thiel keeps employing the ""MaraStrategy""

Most of this DD focuses on $MARA compared to $MSTR, I compared multiple tickers before determining $MARA was the best play.

With that out of the way, lets dive into the always sunny bull case for $MARA  
\---

💊MaraStrategy

For this section please humor me by assuming it is near impossible for $BTC to go down and it just continues going up. Think: 'sToNkS oNlY gO uP' type shit 😌

Thanks to the pioneers and investors in MicroStrategy an asymmetrical opportunity has presented itself. $MARA or Marathon Digital Holdings mines bitcoin and holds bitcoin, a shit-ton of it. In fact its the largest mining company by market cap with the largest $BTC holdings after $MSTR.

The ""MaraStrategy"" (codename: 💊) is an ambitious prospect of acquiring, holding and utilizing $BTC. Basically borrowing money against its holdings to buy $BTC and in turn providing that investment opportunity to its shareholders. $MSTR CEO Michael Saylor has derived this creative business model that is pushing both industry and the world at large into securing $BTC holdings. A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind, highly recommend listening to his vision for bitcoin from interviews on youtube.

$MARA happens to be in the best position to replicate what $MSTR is doing.  
\- They have plenty of expertise and experience within the sector.  
\- A forward thinking CEO (s/o Fred👋) who has already began executing the MicroStrategy model.  
\- One of the strongest mining operations.  
\- Fresh infrastructure investment prepped for halving.  
\- A growing reputation of HODLing $BTC.  

So why not just buy $MSTR? ""They were first!"" They will come out on top... right? Yes and no. They are currently utilizing their $BTC holdings better than anyone else. However, the $BTC value per share would be reduced if everyone just kept buying in, driving it higher as shares are diluted. $MSTR still has to pay their ""debts"" over time (which is crucial because $BTC takes time to go up \[I'm simplifying this slightly\]). Plus their option premiums are pricey 😤

We are starting to see other companies switching from purely fiat currency to diversified holdings with $BTC, daily.

To be clear I am not saying $MSTR is done running at all. My conviction is simply that $MARA presents an asymmetrical opportunity to get (fuck you) money from (irresponsible) option positions because it is an early adopter of the same strategy and is currently wildly undervalued by comparison 🤑

Hopefully you kept in mind what I said about $BTC not going down, it helps understand the premise.  
Also its true (facts no cap on god frfr), $BTC is just going to keep rising, its inevitable. Although if it has a big dipperino all this goes to shit... but its a bull market so we're throwing caution to the wind 🙃  
\---

🤯Catalysts

If I can ask you to only read and consider one of these, really have a deep think 🧠 on the first one, the rest are bonuses:

₿itcoin - I was a skeptic years ago, now adoption is imminent. Bitcoin is the world's reserve currency. The biggest catalyst of all is the value of $BTC and the fact it's being adopted by EVERY person, EVERY business and EVERY country. The people drove the companies to invest and the companies are driving the countries to invest. Read it again. It's a rich man's world and they are going to want to ensure their wealth is secured. Without getting into the weeds you have to acknowledge fiat currency is inferior in some ways. Bitcoin's monetary value fluctuates, its use-cases expand but fundamentally its societal value is static and has remained intact since manifestation. No one knows what price $BTC is going to but I bet my dick it's much higher than 100k 🚀

Continued aggressive purchasing of $BTC, the sooner the better. Fred Theil needs to show he's committed to following the MaraStrategy model. Then he needs to utilize the holdings to purchase against for more $BTC and to expand operations because the main business needs to also benefit from the increased holding for shareholder value.

Investors flooding in from both retail and institutional have been a huge driving factor of bitcoins positive price action. It is easier to access bitcoin now because you don't have to directly buy $BTC, $MSTR, $IBIT and now $MARA give simple, cheap and liquid ways to diversify in $BTC as fiat currency loses some ""market share"" to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin commonly held by public companies/governments like the transition from paper to software it is undoubtedly going to be a critical investment in the future and holding out means losing out. Especially for public companies where cash holdings are scrutinized, do you really believe undiversified cash reserves are going to remain competitive? Chew on this, $BTC has increased in value as fiat currencies are depreciating and we have seen $MSTR has been outperforming a majority of companies, less than a year ago it was valued at less than 10B now its valued 10x higher at nearly 100B, they have 33B in $BTC alone. This isn't some small cap ssq run up, it's leveraged to the tits 🫦 but its achieving incredible value.

Infinite Money Glitch 🤯 $BTC goes up, which means $MARA's holdings go up, profits per coin from mining goes up, stock goes up, allows them to buy more $BTC, $BTC goes up ♻️ $MARA has the perfect supporting business for this they are literally PRINTING MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, must be funny.

There is a critical mass where companies and countries all start jumping in, buying $BTC and that causes $BTC to go fucking parabolic and $MARA to go marabolic -- its about to be a goddamn gold rush and picks ⛏️ are on sale.

Small positives but worth noting  
\- Mining stocks are finally catching up to $BTC giving some extra momentum and volume  
\- China does the most mining in the world and its courts just confirmed $BTC is property and therefore is now legal for cities to own.  
\- With all Crypto rising $MARA can also mine other coins if it makes sense, they have pivoted before to coins providing better financial value.  
\- Saylor just tweeted ""$MARA is a company on the #Bitcoin Standard."" We have Daddy's approval 😏  
 \---

🤓Numbers

I had break my 🚫 no math on weekends rule to write this, ain't it sad?

I am only going to go over $MARA compared to $MSTR, they have the most bitcoins and $MSTR is $MARA's biggest competitor. Numbers are from Nov 21st, assume a $BTC value of 98k. Premium calculations are taken from u/Jazzlike_Record_8915 on Reddit, they obviously fluctuate daily but I am just using them to illustrate a point.

While the value of $MSTR is derived 99% from its $BTC holdings essentially making it just a proxy, $MARA has an operational business valued at $3B so lets factor that in to calculate the premium paid per Bitcoin.

Holdings Value (Bitcoin):  
\- $MARA $3.191B - $MSTR $32.457B  
   
Gross Equity (Operating Company Value):  
\- $MARA $6.391B - $MSTR $32.957B  
   
Net Equity (After Debt):  
\- $MARA $4.972B - $MSTR 24B  
   
Market Cap:  
\- $MARA $7.92B - $MSTR $117B  
   
Premium per share:  
\- $MARA 1.59x - $MSTR 4.87x  
   
Implied price per $BTC  
\- $MARA $156k - $MSTR $477k

🤔 156k vs 477k per $BTC

Ahaaaaahh! Do you like paying a 3x higher premium? I mean that shits just gonna keep inflating but my boy Fred, over at Marathon Digital Holdings, he's putting his business to work.

Last report states $MARA mined 717 $BTC in Oct, thats > 23 a day and \~8.6k $BTC a year. If they didn't purchase a single bitcoin for a year their holding would still grow 20% from mining alone 🌱

Value wise there is no doubt $MARA > $MSTR.

📊Technical Analysis

The charts look fucking glorious, full on 🐂ish, every chart in the market is pointing to $BTC rising. I only know how to do bargain bin TA for short term moves, check this guy out for the yearly picture, hes a freaking 🧙‍♂️ at calling movement before it happens.  
[https://youtu.be/did1gn5LR0M?si=mApqSf4VrLcte2JK&t=518](https://youtu.be/did1gn5LR0M?si=mApqSf4VrLcte2JK&t=518)  
In his latest $MARA analysis he notes it to be incredibly bullish as it breaks above the current level ($24) toward $41 and if it can reach that it has a chance to really run ($100+), only 6 mins long and very thorough.

😮‍💨Conclusion

$MARA so hot right now 🥵

My apologies if the DD was a bit cooked, between the Twisted Teas and my self diagnosed ADHD, shit took a lot more time than I expected but it was worth it. If you want a better DD look at the $MSTR ones and apply the thesis, same same. Also I hand wrote this myself, no chatgpt, the least you could do is buy the stock or leave a fuckin' comment eh 🫵🧐

✊How to Play - Buy, Hold, Repeat.

In my dreams I have a plan, my conviction is that $MARA hits at least $120 in 2025, but I'm not stopping there.  
You can try swing trading this shit but the moves will happen fast and sometimes in the pre-market, I think B&H is better.

Plays ordered by highest profit potential:  
\- 💎Buy options now, make the maximum on degenerate bets, rinse, repeat, reinvest - 20x your portfolio.  
\- 💰Wait until $MARA starts deviating more from $MSTR and other mining companies, buy stock & 1 month out options and keep rolling profits into shares.  
\- 💵Buy stock now, take 25% out every time it doubles: $50, $75, $100, $125  
\- 🤡Wait until its too late.

Prepare for a significant NVDA pullback until the company reports more conclusively positive numbers on Blackwell ,1gz4w5n,LateApostate,2024-11-25 05:04:20,4,0.52,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gz4w5n/prepare_for_a_significant_nvda_pullback_until_the/,"My breakdown touches upon:  

1)        Overall market context; 2) NVDA specific policy changes coming under Trump administration 

Overall market context is important, especially if we are headed for a correction or a consolidation period after the period of exuberance we have seen across asset classes. 

The overall market has largely yawned at potential tariffs, regulatory framework, and possibility of more export controls to Chinese market that could be enacted under a second Trump administration. Ex Goldman analyst Robin Brooks has alerted that markets are discounting the prospect of tariffs and how their effects could be really damaging for equities in 2025 ([https://www.benzinga.com/24/11/42134031/markets-got-it-wrong-after-elections-prospects-of-tariffs-not-good-for-equities-vs-dollar-says-ex-goldman-sachs-analyst](https://www.benzinga.com/24/11/42134031/markets-got-it-wrong-after-elections-prospects-of-tariffs-not-good-for-equities-vs-dollar-says-ex-goldman-sachs-analyst)). I don’t know whether there is hyperbole here, and if tariffs will actually cause pain for stocks, but it is at least worrying that the market has not seemed to care at all now that we know Trump will take office in January.

Goldman Sachs’ forecast shows robust 2.5% growth for the US economy in 2025, with slightly worst results if Trump enacts a 10% tariff on all imports. ([https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-exchanges/2025-outlook-will-tailwinds-trump-tariffs/OutlooksFinalTranscript.pdf](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-exchanges/2025-outlook-will-tailwinds-trump-tariffs/OutlooksFinalTranscript.pdf)) Frankly, I believe Goldmans’ forecasting model is overly optimistic for two reasons. First, their estimates does not include a 10% across-the-board tariff on all imported goods, which Trump campaigned on. Nor does it include a scenario in which a large deportation program – both of which could have the effect of suppressing economic growth if implemented.

Wage growth has largely slowed and consumers would feel fatigued if a new bout of inflation rips across the economy—this would definitely have an impact on earnings. On top of this, a weakening labor market seems to threaten consumers’ comfortability with rising prices again.

One could argue that Trump’s immigration policies, including his plan for a large deportation initiative could see a tighter labour market, and rising wages that could counter a weakening labor market and slowing wage growth. But it’s important to be cognizant of the fact that tariffs would happen instantly, whereas deportations take time, and their effects would not be felt immediately throughout the economy.

Now that I’ve covered the overall market context, let’s get specific on NVDA.

Since NVDA reported earnings last week, the stock price has seesawed in pre-market trading as well as during trading hours. There has been plenty of pontification by market analysts either discounting or raising concerns about slowing sales growth and lower guidance going forward. The stock ended last week largely down, with significant selling happening on Friday.

But I want to focus on what’s in store for NVDA under a the administration.

Howard Lutnick, nominated by President-elect Donald Trump as Secretary of Commerce and USTR, has signaled his commitment to intensifying export controls on advanced semiconductors and related technologies to China. Lutnick’s statements and policy positions suggest a focus on maintaining U.S. dominance in critical technologies, particularly in the semiconductor sector, as a countermeasure to China's rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and military applications.

In a recent interview, Lutnick described semiconductors as ""the cornerstone of America's technological edge"" and emphasized that ""export controls are not merely economic tools but strategic weapons to protect our national security."" He has voiced strong support for continuing and expanding the Biden administration's measures, including targeting AI chips and semiconductor manufacturing tools.

Under Lutnick's guidance, policies could further restrict sales of Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell chips to China. He has highlighted concerns about these chips enabling advanced AI capabilities that could be leveraged by the Chinese military. Lutnick stated, ""We cannot afford to let cutting-edge American technology become a tool for our adversaries,"" signaling potential restrictions on Nvidia and other U.S. tech firms developing high-performance semiconductors.

 The implications of Lutnick's policies could be significant. Stricter controls on exports, including modifications to loopholes that allowed companies like Nvidia to tailor products for the Chinese market, might accelerate China's efforts toward semiconductor self-sufficiency. U.S. firms could face reduced revenues, but Lutnick argues that ""short-term sacrifices are essential for long-term strategic security”.

In addition, we cannot discount the Biden administration making last minute policy moves to box in opponents and make it harder for the new incoming administration to deviate. This has already been reported by Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/technology/chamber-commerce-sees-new-us-export-crackdown-china-email-says-2024-11-22/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chamber-commerce-sees-new-us-export-crackdown-china-email-says-2024-11-22/)). According to this report, the Biden administration is set to enact new regulations could make up to another 200 Chinese chip companies subject to a trade restriction list that bars most U.S. suppliers from shipping goods to the targeted firms. This news broke on Friday, but ten minutes before the market closed. If this is correct, it will put price pressure on the semiconductor sector, which could affect NVDA as well.

 I really do believe given this context, we are entering a period where NVDA could suffer, at least until we have more clarity on tariffs, export control regulations, and Blackwell sales numbers which won’t be reported on for some time.

The largest NVDA drawdowns that have happened recently (March-April; June-August; August-September) averaged anywhere between 21-30%. Smaller, more muted corrections have also occurred of around 10% in the stock since. A similar effect here (10% or so from its high of 152.88 would bring shares close to 137, and break through a key support level. A larger plunge could see it closer to 120 or below.

All in all, a dip here would be a good opportunity to buy up shares at a discounted price.

 I will be holding cash for buying on what I believe will be significant dips coming in the coming weeks, in the lead-up to inauguration and what will be a flurry of announcements as Trump will want to signal change and do so in true Trump fashion: loudly.

* **Digital Transformation in Restaurants:** As more restaurants modernize their operations, there's an increasing shift toward integrated POS solutions that handle everything from payments to inventory management, customer engagement, and analytics. It does it all, not just payments.

Bitcoin ETF ideas for those of us that have been in since launch…,1gyxmnm,gtbifmoney,2024-11-24 23:51:30,98,0.72,239,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gyxmnm/bitcoin_etf_ideas_for_those_of_us_that_have_been/,"I just realized options are now available on the bitcoin ETF’s.  I had been waiting for this!  I have 1000 shares of IBIT that are massively green, and I don’t see any reason not to sell covered calls against them.  At market open, someone is going to pay me almost $20,000 to lock in 10 contracts @ $100 strike price expiring in 2027.

That means IBIT would have to more than DOUBLE in just 2 years, for that buyer ***JUST TO BREAK EVEN*** for me to “lose money” on the trade.  So why the fuck would I not take that bet?  Even though I’m bullish!  I’m going to take your free $20,000 right now, sell you those contracts, and with that money I’m going to buy 350 more shares.  If IBIT goes anywhere near $100 a share by expiration, I’ll have far exceeded profits needed to close most of, if not ALL of those contracts out and have even more shares than I did before.

Before: 1000 shares
After: 1350 shares (1000 are covered by contract)

Here’s a “worst case” type scenario, IBIT 3x in 2 years to $150.  Looking at NVDA as a good comparison, sitting at $140 right now, I can look at the cost to close this week’s contract (I’d wait til close to expiry so that’s why I say this week’s) @ $100 would be $4,200 per contract so $42,000 for 10 of them.

The 350 shares I bought at $55 would be worth $52,500 for a net gain of $33,250.  So now I am able to sell just 270 shares at $150/piece to come up with the $42,000 I need to close those contracts and keep my shares, plus I’d have 80 more shares than I had to begin with.

So at the end of the day, even in a worst case scenario (stock jumps WAY over the strike I sold) I’m still a winner!

Best case scenario is IBIT ends Jan 2027 at $99.99 and above $38/share which would be my adjusted cost basis if I buy 350 shares at current $55 price.

In no scenario whatsoever can I lose, other than the complete collapse of BTC, which is always a possibility with anything so it’s an inherent risk of participation so it doesn’t count.",2024-11-24,0.9747,Positive,"['ETF', 'IBIT', 'IBIT', 'JUST', 'TO', 'BREAK', 'EVEN', 'IBIT', 'ALL', 'IBIT', 'NVDA', 'WAY', 'IBIT', 'BTC']"

McDonald’s (MCD) is scrambling faster than a breakfast egg because their Melitta espresso machines just got yeeted out of every U.S. store. Safety concerns = no lattes, no cappuccinos, no mocha frappes. 🍮 A total 13,500 stores affected = $193M in financial black holes. But wait—it gets worse.

The Drama
You know how they’re always like, “Sorry, the ice cream machine’s broken”? Well, now the espresso machines are dead too. McDonald’s had to RIP them out of every U.S. location because of some “unspecified safety concern.” I mean, who’s getting hurt by a cappuccino? Karen’s third-degree burn from asking for “extra hot”? 🔥☕

The Numbers
Here’s where it gets wild, fam. McDonald’s serves 27.2M customers a day in the U.S.:
	•	810K espresso drinks lost per day = $2.4M/day in lost sales.
	•	People skipping meals because no coffee = another $1.2M/day gone.
	•	That’s $153M in lost profit if this drags on for 60 days.
	•	Oh, and replacing the machines? Another $40.5M.

tl;dr: Existing Trump trade stocks seem to have hit, so maybe next derivative to 10x is the Kushner trade (specifically around small caps), and all things associated with Thrive Capital? Oscar Health (OSCR) seems to be his favorite.

I've been watching current and past Thrive Capital Investments (Josh Kushner, brother of Jared Kushner Trump son-in-law) since the election.

Josh's firm, Thrive, seems to be great at picking winners with exits on Instagram, HIMS, LMND, CART, and currently with larger stakes in OpenAI and Oscar Health

\----- 

EDIT - Here is how I’m playing this ‘kushner’ and disruptive tech trade until March 2025. *I am regarded. I trade on vibes and patterns*

How I'm playing this (Calls: OSCR, LMND, HIMS, TSLA. Shares: BETR, LMND, TSLA):

1. OSCR shares and calls expiring March 2025 (health tech). Given the rate of DOGE announcements, I expect healthcare-related solutions to be pitched in next 1-2 months.
2. BETR shares (mortgage tech). This is still down 20x but has survived past 3 years, runway and an all in CEO (like PLTR, LMND). I hope/believe this is similar to Carvana. I got 3 mortgages through Better, know the CEO is a savage and survivor (zoom layoff CEO), and align with the company mission.
3. HIMS calls expiring Dec 27th 2024. I think thanksgiving convos and Xmas - there will be a lot of “what’s new smalltalk”. And many of those convos will circle around “hey, so I got these \_\_\_ pills from Hims - and life is great!” Pills include boner pills, hair growth pills, anti-anxiety / depression, and now GLP-1s. Likely Ketamine is on the horizon. Amazon will likely win longer-term, but maybe HIMS can be #2. 
4. LMND shares. This has already 3x’ed this month, but this could be next PLTR for insurance. Also big potential for a short squeeze here as stock has gone from $16-> $50 in 3 weeks, AND 30% short interest hasn’t covered 😅. This is now a crowded trade btw with its own subreddit - Lemonapes :D
5. I trade about with 25% of my peanuts while remaining 75% is in TSLA shares and calls.

**Tldr thesis:**

* There is a small cap rotation happening to superior tech innovators from 2020/2021 IPOs (most has already happened - Affirm, Palantir, Carvana, Peloton, etc.)
* Extreme Bull case is all of these small caps that didn’t die in past 3-4 years rebound as much as Carvana has (currently at 60x from low)

**Meta thesis (posted more** here**):**

* The transition of power, government, capital, and 'influence' will move from baby boomers (people that look like Pelosi or Mitch McConnell) will now transition to generation X (all in pod people, thiel, musk, theo von, rogan naval, balaji).
* They have disrupted 80% of industries owned by the baby boomers with the final boss being government. Which they just won. And will be on a warpath with DOGE
* All remaining shitty consumer experiences and entrenched older ways of doing things from misaligned incentives, grifts, and lobbylists (think shitty software like Concur, Cost+ contractors, Turbotax, NASA) will be fixed as part of this X generation transition.

It doesn't produce cash flow. It doesn't have any specific uses. It's not tangible. There's no way to value it.

But, that doesn't really matter. The important aspect of it is that it's a universally agreed upon store of value. Most stores of value are intangible and arbitrarily valued based on supply and demand (whether that demand is based on any sensible valuation methodology or not). While gold does have some physical use cases, the valuation is primarily driven by it being an agreed upon store of value.

Bitcoin is a scarce asset. There is a known maximum supply. It's easier to store and transport/transfer than gold. Most importantly, it was the first crypto and will always have the biggest brand name. It has global demand. The US is proposing a strategic reserve similar to gold, and other countries will follow.

Is it the greater fool theory? Sort of. But, it's becoming a widely  utilized store of value that can act as a hedge against fiscal recklessness and federally issued currency inflation.

It will replace gold because it's simply easier to transact and store. Gold has a market cap of 17 trillion, while bitcoin is around 2 trillion. As investment institutions, sovereign nations, and individuals continue to acquire it, the fixed supply will result in the price increasing whether you think that's silly or not.

It will probably reach 1 million dollars per coin in a matter of years, as inflation continues and it overtakes gold as the primary global store of value.",2024-11-24,0.9893,Positive,['US']

Reference: is a seeking alpha article which is easy to google and not posted because of Reddit rules. 

PS: Currently hold around $20k in MSTR stocks

A summary part from a section of article

Critics argue that MicroStrategy’s valuation reflects speculative excess. The company’s fully diluted market cap—its theoretical value if all convertible notes and stock options are converted into shares—is approximately $106 billion, far exceeding its Bitcoin holdings' market value of $31.2 billion. Adjusting for $4.2 billion in debt, this premium appears even more pronounced.

Moreover, the feedback loop driving MicroStrategy’s stock performance depends on continued Bitcoin appreciation and ETF inflows. If either of these factors reverses, MicroStrategy’s valuation could rapidly ""revert to the mean.""

I started by buying 10 stocks, including Celsius, Tesla, Arm, Ferrari, and others. My portfolio grew to $18k. From there, it fluctuated, and at the time, I knew nothing about options. Eventually, I decided to throw it all into one name when I saw its price spiking. My account hit $30k for the first time. However, I still hadn’t learned to take profits and was stuck in a scarcity mindset, feeling like I had to ride every trade ‘to the max.’ 🤦

After watching my portfolio tank back to $12k, I started revenge trading to recover losses but ended up nearly losing everything. That experience pushed me to learn about options, including the Greeks, implied volatility, and moneyness.

I then switched strategies, deciding to buy longer-dated options (LEAPS) with strikes that were somewhat ITM. I focused on companies that were ‘promising’ for the near to long term and had been beaten down. Instead of buying high and selling low, I started buying stocks at cheaper prices and simply waiting.

Over time, my account began growing steadily as I stuck to my strategy and waited for my take-profit targets to be hit. I traded into hyped small-caps before eventually selling all my positions to go all-in on quantum.

I'm not sure how many people remember but I made a hugely upvoted post here 6 months ago about winning $100k in just one hour by doing some crazy options gambling. The sad thing was I lost all of that $100k plus lost a further almost $80k in like a week later by thinking I could replicate my success yet again. I deleted that 100k post of mine after that out of shame but I still have like 100+ people that had private msg'ed me from that post alone.

June was really the lowest point in my journey here as you can see in the image. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought I could have made every single penny back plus a whooping $35k more by the end of this year. And it's not even the end of the year! I actually could've earned another $30k extra last week if not for some dumb mistakes lol

I had to change my entire outlook on investing after that June fiasco and believe it or not, I never bought any options ever since then. I wasn't going the crazed gambling route again and for the past 2 months I actually made very little gains but it was a low risk route I took.

My $130k gain only came about in the past 2 weeks' bull market and by constantly changing up my stocks instead of bagholding. There's still been a lot of regrets here and there in how I wished I made some trading moves that could've earned me even more money,  but I guess I cant be too greedy.",2024-11-23,-0.4492,Negative,[]

Earnings were very good, beating on both EPS and rev, but guidance came in conservative.  Gross margins were also down slightly to 74.6% from 75.1% in the previous quarter(still insane numbers).  The issue with this slight deceleration is that the stock is priced for exponential growth like we’ve been seeing for a couple years now.  That ridiculous growth may be slowing down a little for now, and their new Blackwell chips are still rolling out.  We don’t know what kind of revenue those will bring in yet.  The stock got plenty of price hikes post earnings, but nothing too significant(160-170’s for the most part).  It just seems like the train is slowing down a bit.  

As far as the chart goes, it has tried to break and hold $149-150 7 times since November 6.  It briefly broke over the day after earnings, but was quickly bitch slapped back below that threshold.  IMO, this earnings report was the catalyst that it needed to get over that resistance, and it has clearly failed to do so. So the question is: where do we go from here?  We’re right on the trend line that it’s held since September 6.  We could go higher, but earnings failed to impress the market, and it doesn’t seem like we have enough gas to pump it higher just yet.  We saw some significant selling pressure today without any buyers stepping in EOD.  I think that trend continues Monday and we break the trend line.  That is a solid red daily candle today, and I expect to see a gap down and another candle just like that on Monday. I would love to see it hit the 100 day EMA(right around $130) and bounce from there.  Thats definitely the spot to load up on calls if you’re still bullish(which you should be).  

One more risk over the next few days and weeks:  geopolitical tensions.  Normally we just ignore everything Putin says, but the escalation of launching an Oreshnik ICBM and hitting Dnipro can not be ignored.

I finally understand and realize how MSTR’s stock could grow so quickly if everything goes as planned. Here’s my view of a relatively bullish scenario that could unfold by the end of 2024:

In just the last two weeks, Saylor bought 29K and 52K BTC using stock offerings (ATMs). As the stock price and trading volume are now much higher (2x from last week plus stock price is 50% higher), he’ll likely buy even more BTC weekly.

Let’s assume the premium remains steady, allowing Saylor to keep leveraging it to buy as much BTC as possible. If he continues issuing shares through ATM programs and announces new purchases weekly, and adds debt every two weeks as he’s been doing, the pace could accelerate further.

He might even raise more than the planned $42B since the demand is there. It's insane, how fast they are growing. He said he will get $1.7B debt, then two days later he raised to $2.6B, and after several hours announced $3B. All this happened this week.  
If no one intervenes, he could potentially aim for holding 20% of all BTC—around 4 million coins. But this scenario stops at 1.38M BTC by the EOY 2024.

These numbers feel realistic yet conservative. If things heat up further, this could look even more dramatic. Although the stock trading volume is growing, here the assumption is that it will decrease.

Just two weeks ago, these projections would have seemed completely ridiculous to me. But now, it’s all starting to make sense.

$U - A potential game engine comeback story.,1gxj4i7,GradientOGames,2024-11-23 03:09:14,41,0.88,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gxj4i7/u_a_potential_game_engine_comeback_story/,"Wanted to try it out so here's my first 'analysis'! Let me know if my points are valid and if my structuring is good or not.

Firstly for some background information, $U or Unity Software Inc is primarily game engine company where although producing a relatively good game engine, has made some incredibly poor choices - such as mass layoffs and diverging from their engine to focus more on advertising, merging with Iron Source. The company peaked in value November '21 at almost $200 (USD) where the company began merging with other companies, months after the decently successful IPO - the first merger being with Weta Digital. After that peak, it was all downhill from there tumbling into the $40s over the course of two years, where Unity made gaming history by announcing the runtime fee. This lead to the regarded CEO resigning (the CEO that once ran EA, go figure) and most of management being fired, with major restructuring a few months after occurring under interim CEO Jim Whitehurst and then Matthew Bromberg, where they promised to work on what truly mattered, the engine itself.

In recent times, Unity has made great strides in their engine with massive new features on the way - promising better performance (they don't say it, but they subtly hint it in their advertising that Unity is the engine for good performance, as opposed to Unreal), and new innovative uses of that big A word that investors climax over. They announced Unity 6, their big update and reversion back to a normal naming system as opposed to their weird yearly naming scheme (which was objectively bad for pressuring new releases on a yearly schedule), and announced 6.1 with some features currently in alpha releases, and some credible promises for later big versions which they appear committed on.

Overall, they seem to be on a comeback, at least on the engine side. Financially, they've been recovering from the whole runtime debacle (around Q4-23) where the next quarter being their first missed earnings for a while, by quite a bit as well. Where only recently in Q2-24 have they started to beat the target and are on track to go above $0 per share in the next two years. In addition, as a result of the cancellation of the runtime fee and the new CEO reaching out to businesses and the community, growth has been re-sparked. Moreover, their profits from their engine have increased 5% year over year and is still going strong. In the recent Q3 earnings their total profits in EBITDA is over 10% over their initial estimate of $70-80m at $92m.

My verdict, is that the company under its new leadership has shifted its focus towards the user. They are focussing on updating their engine without hurting users using older features, and are in the testing phases of new AI technologies for both advertising (reducing ROI and boosting user acquisition + monetary gain), and game development (with two AI systems for both helping developers make games, and running AI within games for either NPCs or game systems). Thus, after a 'company reset' they seem to be on the track to make a profit and become the defacto game engine - one that won't be made fun of crappy games.

Disclaimer - this is not financial advice. I'm a game developer and I enjoy using their engine (which is how I can say the engine is getting far better in recent releases for engine users), I recently got into trading/investing and I read these analysis posts or bets, and I decided to try one out myself.

How'd I do?

I Think PayPal is Still Very Undervalued ,1gxio2s,One-Hovercraft-1935,2024-11-23 02:49:14,10,0.56,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gxio2s/i_think_paypal_is_still_very_undervalued/,"**11/22/24**

As the title states, I believe PayPal Holdings, Inc. is still very undervalued. With a YTD return of +41.60%, and 5-year return of -16.46%, there is still a lot of room to recover. 

PayPal Holdings, Inc. is a digital payment and transaction company that connects consumers to businesses worldwide. On top of this, they have a large presence in the P2P payment market. They are essentially a digital wallet allowing you to store all of your payment and banking information. They also provide loans to businesses and individuals through their buy now pay later program. Through their facilitation of digital payments, they have a presence in 200 countries and receive tons of traffic. In 2023, PayPal alone processed $1.53 trillion dollars in payment volume, a 12% increase YoY. This is an extremely large and well-established company with 27,200 employees, bringing in north of $30 billion in revenue. 

**Main Subsidiaries** 

[PayPal's Main Subsidiaries ](https://preview.redd.it/uewklqydgi2e1.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0cbd3ddd160b9a994e23123abf51dbf7cd53668)

**Venmo Highlights** 

**Total Payment Volume - $276 billion. 13.1 % increase YoY**

**2023 Net income - $1.1 billion. 18.2% increase YoY**

**Very fast-growing platform displaying consistent user growth, TPV growth, and active account growth.** Venmo is currently only in the US, which I think represents a good potential opportunity for expansion into foreign markets.

[Venmo Annual Users](https://preview.redd.it/z0e1vglgli2e1.png?width=409&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea56768256c9b5faaa3c38c6c1ffa398be30630e)

The market size for digital transactions is estimated to grow at a double-digit CAGR from 2024-2032. The largest growth coming from the Asia-Pacific region. PayPal is able to capitalize on this by their facilitation of cross-border transactions. Just think of the increase in digital transactions you've experienced in the past 5 years. Cash is becoming obsolete; everything is turning digital. This is great for PayPal as 90% of their revenue comes from transactions.

Increases in digital payment transactions demonstrates a positive correlation with PayPal TPV.

**PayPal Holdings, Inc. Q3 2024 Highlights** 

**Transaction Revenue - $7,067 billion. 6% increase YoY**

**Total Revenue - $7,847 billion. 6% increase YoY**

**Total Payment Transactions - $6,631 billion. 6% increase YoY**

**Transactions Per Active Account - 61.4. 9% increase YoY**

**Total Payment Volume - $422,641 billion. 9% increase YoY**

**Conclusion -** I believe the market for digital payments and transactions is very young, bound to experience tremendous growth in the coming years. As the dominant player in this market, PayPal Holdings, Inc. is incredibly well poised to grow. It is simple, the more transactions that take place, the more money the company makes.

MARA vs MSTR vs HUT: Bitcoin treasury comparisons,1gxh9vu,Jazzlike_Record_8915,2024-11-23 01:48:10,49,0.89,100,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gxh9vu/mara_vs_mstr_vs_hut_bitcoin_treasury_comparisons/,"https://preview.redd.it/6dhobb43hi2e1.png?width=971&format=png&auto=webp&s=362823b3680fec6fb1b8186bf1717e49f46c2920

I made a comparison of the top btc-linked equities who own the most btc... a) MSTR, b) MARA, and c) HUT ... i want to preface this by saying *all* BTC-linked equities deserve *some* premia in a bull market. The question is how much & when.

MSTR was trading at $478K per bitcoin yesterday morning... so yesterday's correction was *good* news... it re-rated... to <$400K per bitcoin... i have a feeling the premia is gona expand again though and Saylor will tap the convert markets 3-4x more from now until the Spring. The stock can double from here. Because MSTR's software operations are winding down, it justifies its premia by promising it will be a sort of 'bitcoin bank' in the future. TBD.

MARA was never really known on Wall Street for its HODL, but since the shares were flat as BTC went from $60K to $90K, the HODL now puts it in the top 3 BTC treasury plays. In the past, 80-90% of MARA's market cap was attributable to its operating company: the mining facilities. That has now changed. It's become more & more of a BTC proxy. This is a monumental shift. I didn't believe it 100% until I crunched the numbers, and looked at their latest debt offering... MARA is a top 2 mining/HODL play. It's a new landscape for miners.

HUT was always known as the classic HODL play if you didn't want to touch MSTR... especially as BTC ETFs didn't have any options contracts. If you wanted levered long BTC exposure, you had to either play MSTR or HUT. When MSTR got out of control, traders looked to call options on HUT to get that levered long exposure. HUT is still the biggest HODL play in the mining arena, and due to the recent underperformance, it's also the best value (in terms of cheapest price per BTC). HUT shareholders have also been much less diluted than MARA shareholders, and HUT's float is much tighter than MARA's. Furthermore, HUT's short intrst is double MARA's, creating extra volatility. I suspect the options market on HUT will begin to price this in as HUT shares begin to move again, but nobody knows. They can always sink too. HUT's smaller size has the added benefit of making it a more realistic M&A target (for both corporates and PE), which is always a nice uplift due to the premia often paid to shareholders in a buyout scenario. I like both HUT and MARA at these levels.

$PACS - skilled nursing facilities (SNF) assisted living facilities in the USA (in short Nursing home)  
Provides senior care and independent facilities, buy/lease real-estate for health care related properties

Founded in Utah in 2013, IPO in 2024  
Similar company: $ENSG  
Revenue: Coming from leasing facilities and insurance reimbursement based on the number of residents  
Finalized acquisition by taking over operations of Prestige Care’s entire SNF portfolio i.e 56 facilities across 6 states and added 2889 skilled nursing beds

Occupancy rate of 94% for all facilities they have managed for 18 months  
  
Why PACS? 

Hindenburg research made a claim that PACS is inflating their numbers by abusing covid era waiver to make more money as well as misleading investors with wrong CMS ratings.  
The claim is that the same revenue cannot be achieved and possibly fraud

What's the waiver about? It allowed beneficiaries to receive Medicare-covered SNF care without a prior hospital stay of at least three days. It expired with the end of the federal Public Health Emergency (PHE) on **May 11, 2023**

=> PACS have seen a sharp decline after those allegations leading to more than 60% decline, below it's IPO price!

Furthermore, they delayed their earnings because of that only releasing preliminary earnings: [https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/113/pacs-group-provides-preliminary-third-quarter-operational-metrics](https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/113/pacs-group-provides-preliminary-third-quarter-operational-metrics)

So:

\* Based on it they are still beating expectations and they stated that they are aware of those allegations and working with government entities and another 3rd party audit to make sure that they were always compliant.   
\* Fraud allegations are not related to cooked books but rather using Covid-era to pump up revenue  
\* Covid era waiver is long gone but revenue is still up  
  
This could go both ways: if the claim made by Hindenburg research was actually wrong PACS could easily go back to $40 (i.e almost doubling current price)  
If it was indeed true, expect PACS a loss of revenue in the next earning release or two but **the nursing facilities and occupancies aren't going away**.

Death, taxes, and caffeine being centerfold in American society. The explosion of $CELH into the energy drink market took the sector by storm, and investors gobbled up the stock. In four years, the company became the third most popular energy drink in the United States behind just Rebull and Monster, That kind of growth is unprecedented in a stagnant industry like soft drinks.

But then sentiment changed and the exponential growth began to slow as the industry faced inflationary headwinds and gas station traffic decreased. Retail investors dropped CELH faster than the democrats dropped Biden.

I'm here to tell you the market is wrong about Celsius, and in two years you will be wishing you had read this post and got onboard.

The underlying fundamentals of the business are incredibly strong and there remains massive global growth potential. Every quarter, CELH is a profitable business. They posted $0.28 EPS in Q2. They have close to a BILLION dollars of CASH on hand. This past quarter, their largest distributor, Pepsi, did an inventory optimization that decreased sales for the quarter by $150 million and the company STILL broke even for the quarter. CELH announced the inventory optimization is complete and those sales will resume for Q4.

Any business needs to be incredibly healthy to take a one-time $150 million decrease in sales for a quarter on the chin and STILL be operating in the green. Retail investors looked at the decreased quarterly revenue and panic sold the stock without listening to the earnings call and actually understanding the numbers. It was a one-time, inventory optimization with the expectation of sales resuming in Q4. And that's what we've seen with the stock price - while retail investors have abandoned the stock, institutional ownership has increased 400% in 2024.

CELH sales growth in the United States has continued to outpace competition and global marketing/sales remain in the early stages. The top line has enormous grwoth potential in global markets. Meanwhile, in Q3 CELH bought Big Beverages in an all cash transaction in order to vertically integrate one of their major manufacturers. The facility is massive and the acquisition is expected to decrease per-case production cost and further improve margins.

The stock price has already started making a turnaround from the panic selling post-earnings. Thank me in two years.",2024-11-23,0.989,Positive,"['CELH', 'CELH', 'CELH', 'EPS', 'CASH', 'STILL', 'CELH', 'STILL', 'CELH', 'CELH']"

I also participated in some discussions of this in a few threads here yesterday so figured I could post it here as well for all you regards.  It might read a little bit like this is an email I sent to a friend who is financially literate.. because that’s what it is. 

Note: I’m not taking a firm position on what Saylor is doing.  For the record I’m a longtime Bitcoin bull (and semi-maxi) but there’s no such thing as infinite money.  This has massive potential to end badly… but the music is playing a lots of us are dancing.

This post contains some commentary and some of my opinions.  I’m happy to answer questions or correct anything I have wrong but I don’t plan to get drawn into debates about my opinions or the value of bitcoin and whatnot.  That’s a different topic. 

Dear Regards,

So, his convertible bond strategy is actually a hint of genius with a side of trepidation.  Here’s the rundown:

He’s selling 5-year corporate bonds at 0% interest with a convert price that’s about 50% above the current share price (I think that’s the ratio… could change per issuance, not sure).  For this example let’s say the stock is trading at $500 and the convert price is at $750. 

MSTR then uses the bond proceeds to buy bitcoin and add it to their balance sheet.  Bitcoin goes up.  Their value per share goes up.  Numbers go up.   Forever, right?  Right guys??

(See note below on accounting treatment.)

If the bond holder keeps the bonds for the full 5 years they get their principle paid back without interest.  

However if at any point in that 5 years the stock is trading above the convert price, the bond holder can surrender the bond and be issued stock shares (freshly created for the conversion) equivalent to the bond value at the convert price.  So if the shares are trading at $800 they could convert a $1m bond into 1,333 shares ($1m / $750 = 1333) and cancel the bond.  They would then have an implied profit of $66k on their million dollars ($50 above convert x 1333 shares).  They could sell to lock in profits or if they keep the shares they get additional upside/downside (or some combination)

That conversion is dilutive to existing shareholders but it only happens if the stock has already appreciated so the shareholders have been totally fine with it.  

The bond holders have an incentive to convert as it allows them to take profits ahead of the the 5 year term and they can either hold the shares or sell them or some combination.   Of course there is also a secondary market for these bonds and they are trading well above par in anticipation of high convert value. 

Once converted, the bond is paid/void.  So if his stock keeps going up he never has to pay back the bonds (with cash, anyway).

IIRC, the first bond issued like this was at a par value of $100 per share with a $140 convert price.   That was pre-split… so 1/10 that for current value ($10 per share with a $14 convert in today’s shares).  So those folks have done pretty well.  

So, these bonds are giving fixed income investors the upside exposure to Bitcoin and they are absolutely gobbling it up.  Most of those portfolios can’t buy bitcoin and many can’t even buy stocks/ETFs… but Bitcoin, wrapped in stock, wrapped in bonds… shut up and take my money!!!  

What could go wrong 😂

I’ve heard rumors that the next MSTR bond offering is going to be at a negative interest rate (ie investors will have to pay more than face value to buy the bond). 

However if the stock price doesn’t rise and the converts don’t happen, he’s on the hook to pay the bond back at the maturity date.  He has three options: (1) roll the debt into new bonds if the market will tolerate it, (2) pay the bonds off with cash on hand or with cash from the operating side of the business, or (3) sell enough of the underlying bitcoin to raise the cash.  He has said he will “never sell” but when push comes to shove who knows.  

Edit to add: he could also (4) issue additional shares to raise capital to pay off the bonds.  This would dilute shareholders and hurt his stock price but would be a valid strategy if needed. 

Of course if he’s having to sell some of his coins we can assume we are already in a deep bear market.  This selling would of course push the price down further.  Rinse and repeat.  That would suck.  And the more and more of these bonds he sells, the less and less likely it is that the operating business will have enough cash to pay them off.  Could get spicy. 

Importantly none of the Bitcoin are encumbered in these bonds and there is no opportunity for them to be called early or “margin called” in any way even if bitcoin price drops to zero.  They just need to pay off the bonds when they come due (if they ever come due). 

He is aware of the typical 4-year bitcoin boom and bust cycle and I expect he is structuring his maturity dates to account for when he would expect market lows and highs.  But that’s far from a guarantee.  

If he can’t pay the bonds he’s looking at an epic bankruptcy and his coins getting liquidated to pay creditors.  This would also cause massive market selling by essentially everyone frontrunning their bankruptcy sale.  FTX nods with knowing approval.  (Note this isn’t FTX 2.0 here… Saylor is doing this all in the open… this isn’t fraud it’s clever with risk)

His underlying plan is to entice other companies to follow in his footsteps so he’s not the only one pumping bitcoin.  I’m seeing more and more announcements all the time.  People are taking notice of his success.  I think this is really where the systemic risk applies.  MSTR is early to this game.  So far they are playing the game conservatively (well, ok… “conservatively”).    

But as other companies follow him down this path they will get more and more aggressive. It’s human nature.  Take what’s working and leverage it to the tits.  Once we have the lower third of the S&P index all doing the Saylor to goose their profits and bitcoin is trading in the millions and somebody fucks up because they took the bitcoin wrapped in stock wrapped in bonds and wrapped that in dog shit and wrapped that in cat shit and then sold it to the Saudis… the implosion risk is off the charts and it will be a huge risk/impact to the overall markets.  It will also wipe out anyone buying Bitcoin leverage long.  Dont fuck with BTC leverage kids. 

Interestingly tho… even it this all blows up it doesn’t threaten the bitcoin network.  The price will crash, sure, but miners will mine (some will go out of business but others will survive).  The network will still process transactions, there will still only ever be 21million coins.  And the price will recover to some level that reflects future demand.  No idea if it would ever recover to a new all time high… but it would survive and continue to function.   If you have your coins in self-custody you’ll be safe (aside from crying over the massive loss in dollar value).  Some new narrative would take over.  The asset would remain scarce.  A new narrative would emerge.  

Of course then there is all this talk of creating a national Bitcoin reserve where nation states are all in an arms race to aquire BTC.  For the record I’m very unenthusiastic about the National Bitcoin Reserve thing even if it would pump my bags.  It might happen but I don’t love the idea of massive government involvement in bitcoin.  

That said, Bitcoin is a permissionless network so if governments want to buy it there’s nothing anybody can do to stop them.  It’s a feature not a bug.  

Also regarding accounting treatment.  Bitcoin is current held with the tax treatment of “indefinite intangibles”.  This is the most conservative tax treatment possible.  It is for valuing things like art and trading cards.  If the value goes up you cannot recognize the appreciation higher than your purchase price.  If the value goes down you must recognize the loss (as an operating loss!). 

So that really sucks from a corporate perspective and I expect it has kept a lot of companies on the sidelines.  

The FASB accounting rules are changing in 2025 to shift bitcoin to fair value accounting. Going forward companies will mark to market quarterly (or whenever they announce earnings) and it will apply the profit or loss to the corporate treasury balance rather than operating income.   This will be a much more fair treatment and is the right way to do it given that Bitcoin has a very clear price discovery mechanism.  

Importantly, when MSTR reports their first earnings under this new rule, they’re going to be able to recognize all of the performance of all of the Bitcoin they have purchased.  Tons of it has been marked down (impared) since the drop from $69k to $15k.  And they haven’t been able to recognize gains on anything above price paid (ever!) on their official earnings statements.  Their first earnings of 2025 are going to be insanely higher than past and if the street is maintaining this high multiple it will get a lot of attention.  

On the other hand none of this is a secret so it’s probably already priced in.  It could explain some of the crazy price action lately as we get closer to Jan 1.  I think their fiscal year ends Dec31 so Q1 earnings in April would see the 🚀 in their standard balance sheet.  

A brave new world.

tl;dr long Bitcoin, long MSTR, massive risk once tons of other companies follow suit because people are greedy bastsrds and will lever this strategy to the tits and it will blow up in a supernova of financial ruin… and Bitcoin will still keep chugging along same as it ever was.

Simulating buying Microstrategy (MSTR) shares vs buying Bitcoin,1gxa0vc,Lord_Snooty_Pants,2024-11-22 20:42:10,50,0.86,121,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gxa0vc/simulating_buying_microstrategy_mstr_shares_vs/,"My understanding is that the market cap is approximately 3 times the value of its Bitcoin holdings, so for say $100 invested you effectively get $33 worth of the underlying asset, Bitcoin. On the face of it that seems like a bad deal.

Is their strategy to dilute the shareholding and use the proceeds to buy more Bitcoin?

For example, if $10 is raised my shareholding is now 0.91 of what it was originally (now 100/110). There is now $43 worth of Bitcoin, of which I have $39 ($43 x 0.91). Okay, this seems like an improvement from the original starting place – but I would still have done better if I just purchased the underlying asset directly.

Proponents will be quick to point out that by MSTR buying Bitcoin it may push up the price of Bitcoin itself. Let’s assume the price goes up by 20%. Under the above example I end up with $47 worth of Bitcoin for the $100 I invested. If I had simply bought $100 of Bitcoin in the first instance I would now have $120, so it still seems a very bad deal.

Now repeat this ad infinitum, also using different Bitcoin increase percentages and different dilution amounts. Go on, it can be done on a basic spreadsheet! There’s no combination which results in the amount of underlying asset “catching up” with what the value would be by simply buying Bitcoin itself! Therefore, why would anyone who is bullish on Bitcoin buy these shares? Likewise, why would anyone who is bearish on Bitcoin buy the shares when it is basically Bitcoin plus air?

Viasat stock is down hard. From $30 earlier this year to under $9 now. The market’s missing the bigger picture. The business is solid, the strategy is tight, and the upside is big. Here’s why:

The Inmarsat Deal

Viasat bought Inmarsat for $7.3 billion in 2023. Inmarsat gives Viasat a global network with 19 satellites. The deal expands Viasat into aviation, maritime, and enterprise markets. Expected $1.5 billion in synergies will lead to lower costs and better efficiency. This creates the world’s largest satellite communications network.

Growth in Defense and Aviation

Defense revenue grew 37% YoY. Governments want secure satellite communications, and Viasat delivers. The U.S. awarded Viasat a $153 million defense contract this year. Airlines like Delta, United, and American use Viasat for in-flight internet. Post-COVID travel is up. In-flight connectivity demand is growing at 15% CAGR through 2027, and Viasat is leading the way in aviation and secure government contracts.

The Pivot to Enterprise

Viasat is moving away from low-margin residential broadband. The focus is now on enterprise and government clients, which means bigger contracts and higher margins. Enterprise clients need secure, high-bandwidth solutions, and Viasat is filling that gap.

Viasat-3: Game-Changer

Viasat-3 satellites boost global coverage and bandwidth. Speeds are faster, and latency is lower. This puts Viasat in direct competition with Starlink, but with a better focus: enterprise, aviation, and defense. Viasat isn’t chasing consumers; they’re after big contracts.

Synergies from Inmarsat

Combining Inmarsat’s aviation and maritime expertise with Viasat’s technology strengthens both businesses. Cost synergies of $1.5 billion over five years mean better margins. Expanded bandwidth lets Viasat serve more enterprise and defense clients. Inmarsat also has strong cash flow, reducing pressure from acquisition debt.

Political Moves: A Signal

Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz bought Viasat shares this year. The purchase was tied to Viasat’s $153 million defense contract. She’s on the Military Construction Subcommittee and understands defense spending. This signals confidence in Viasat’s positioning in defense markets.

Technicals and Valuation

The stock trades at 0.6x P/S ratio, well below industry averages of 2.5x. Short interest is 17% of the float. High short interest could spark a squeeze if momentum builds. Revenue hit $1.13 billion in Q1 FY25, up 44% YoY, driven by Inmarsat and defense contracts. Long-term, synergies will improve EBITDA margins and cash flow.

Risks

Integrating Inmarsat could take time and resources. Competition from Starlink is real, but Viasat’s enterprise and defense focus keeps them in their lane.

Where It Can Go

Near-term: $15–$18 as revenue and synergies gain recognition. Long-term: $25–$30 as Viasat becomes the dominant player in enterprise satellite communications.

So yes I do think viasat is undervalued, misunderstood, and set for a rebound. Big satellites, strong synergies, and solid growth in defense and aviation make this a strong buy.

"Big win with $hims, FDA didn’t side with pharma like everyone thought they would💊📈
",1gx0t1m,Loogyboy,2024-11-22 11:09:10,94,0.91,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gx0t1m/big_win_with_hims_fda_didnt_side_with_pharma_like/,"**Background:**

* **GLP-1 Demand :** Wegovy (Novo) and Zepbound are dominating the branded weight-loss markets but face demand that they cannot keep up with.
* **Trump’s Legacy:** Under the Trump administration, rules around drug compounding were clarified, allowing pharmacies to fill gaps during shortages. Now, these policies will be central to ongoing lawsuits ([see this executive order](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-ensuring-essential-medicines-medical-countermeasures-critical-inputs-made-united-states/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=ncl_amplify&utm_campaign=230724-agenda47_returning_production_of_essential_medicines_back_to_america_and_ending_bidens_pharmaceutical_shortages&utm_content=ncl-7CGRrbfsEr&_nlid=7CGRrbfsEr&_nhids=NJKu9Lb)).
* **FDA issues:** The FDA pulled tirzepatide (Zepbound/Mounjaro) from the shortage list in October but has since walked back on this after legal challenges, extending the compounding window significantly.

**Why It Matters:**

* **HIMS’ Edge:** FDA uncertainty + Trump-era compounding policies = opportunity for HIMS to take over affordable GLP-1 market.
* **GLP-1 Customer base:** There are even more GLP-1 customers than expected which leaves a huge opportunity to take advantage of.  There is [over 6% of the U.S.](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2024-the-publics-use-and-views-of-glp-1-drugs/#:~:text=Overall%2C%2012%25%20of%20adults%20say,Obesity%20Drugs%20for%20Racial%20Disparities) taking a variant of it currently.
* **Hims Undervalued:** Hims is currently significantly undervalued due to the risk of lawsuits and competitors. My research into their competitors showed that they are not great considering some like RO health require a $145 month subscription to be prescribed GLP-1 which is another $300 a month subscription on top of that vs HIMS being a flat rate $200 a month which includes free chatting with a doctor anytime.
* **Hims In-house Compounding Advantage:** Hims acquired their own [compounding pharmacy](https://news.hims.com/newsroom/building-our-pharmacy-operations-with-the-customer-in-mind) to produce their drugs. This allows them to control the quality and ensure their customers get what they order which is important with compounded drugs. They recently got a [global head of quality & safety](https://investors.hims.com/news/news-details/2024/Hims--Hers-Appoints-Tenured-Pharmaceutical-Regulatory-and-Quality-Experts-to-Key-Leadership-Positions/default.aspx) who has over 30 years in pharma and FDA so the FDA cannot say it is unsafe to compound.
* **Big Pharma Hit:** Lilly and Novo stocks have been tumbling for the past few months due to the wavering support for Medicare/Medicaid covering their drugs for anti-obesity which is now very unlikely to pass with RFK being staunchly against it. It is still possible to get it if you have an added health benefit like Obesity + diabetes etc.

**Takeaway:**

* FDA delays + Trump rules = lifeline for $HIMS. The compounded drug wave could crash if regulators tighten up but the price is already undervalued. This becomes more unlikely further into the Trump presidency as cutting off a European company that has the GDP of Denmark aligns with their goals.

Oh, and Hims added meal replacements today. Branching out and adding more streams of revenue that align with their goals is a +1 in my book.

**TL;DR**: Hims & Hers ($HIMS) was up 11% as the FDA delayed its decision on Eli Lilly’s ($LLY[) Zepbound and Mounjaro shortage status](https://www.barrons.com/articles/eli-lilly-zepbound-wegovy-hims-hers-stock-8e6d9861). This pause keeps compounders going and sets precedence for HIMS when Semaglutide is removed from shortage list. There is also Trumps past executive order which will most likely be pushed through to this situation if the court cases are dragged out. European companies like Novo would be significantly impacted by this and the trump administration will take this as a win.

All of sudden $GAP executives give positive guidance on holiday sales on a analyst call, it makes news and the market bids up the stock today over $3.

Reality Check: Inflation has hammered apparel retailers since 2021 and consumer spending has dramatically dropped. So now we're supposed to believe gigantic crowds will flock to Gap and other retai stores from November to January 1 and the stock will go to $40? Anyone buying that retail will do fantastic this holiday season so all the apparel players: $GAP, $TJX, $BURL, $ROST go up beyond what we saw today in trading?

The last earnings call was pretty bad.  Sales tanked 10% yoy and EPS dropped 26%.  Over the past few years, management decided it was a good idea to focus more on the direct-to-consumer business and took product away from store shelves.  This has proven to be a poor decision, as that business has dropped 13%.   On September 19,  Nike announced Elliot Hill will be the new CEO.  The market loved the move as the stock popped about 12%, but it has since sold off to retest the lows.  Hill is expected to get Nike back on track, but that will take time.  Bill Ackman has upped his stake in NKE recently, going from 2% to 11% of his total portfolio, and Travis Knight(Phil Knight’s son) acquired 3,180,000 shares 3 weeks ago, increasing his stake by 170%.   New CEO Elliot Hill also bought 64,000 shares last month.  

As far as the chart goes, it’s at a very important level.   The $68-70 range has been crucial since before the pandemic.  It was resistance in 2015 and 2018, and support in 2018 once it broke through.  It blasted through this level during covid, but that was an extreme circumstance.  You can see it was also support recently in August after the earnings sell off.  It has since bounced but may be testing the support one more time for a double bottom.  I think it’s going to be very difficult for it to break through this level.  Nike is the premier athletic brand.  They have more revenue that LULU, ON cloud, and Adidas combined.  They’ll figure their shit out, and will get back on track.  

I included the daily chart as well.  I was looking for a retest and hold of $70 to confirm the double bottom, but today had a really candle.  Looking to tomorrow to see if that trend continues.  I doubt they’ll crush earnings this time, but there could be a small run into the report on 12/19, some $80 and $85 calls for 12/20 in hopes of that run and to play the IV as well.

Quantum Gains with $IONQ 🚀 350% and more upside,1gwx77s,Dansilly,2024-11-22 07:52:16,103,0.9,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gwx77s/quantum_gains_with_ionq_350_and_more_upside/,"IonQ is a quantum hardware company that is popping off rn mostly because it has recently secured a major $54.5M Air Force deal ([source](https://ionq.com/news/ionq-announces-largest-2024-u-s-quantum-contract-award-of-usd54-5m-with)). Also, wtih Trump coming in, he is expected to be more open to quantum for defense compared to the Biden administration, who was pretty hands off. On top of that, IonQ recently integrated with Nvidia’s quantum platform to develop a new chemistry application with quantum computing, opening doors to more real-world use cases ([source](https://ionq.com/news/ionq-to-advance-hybrid-quantum-computing-with-new-chemistry-application-and)). Nvidia has a vision to integrate large servers of GPUs with quantum computers ([source](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/solutions/quantum-computing/)).

Its up 350% in the last three months now valued at \~7bil, but with more possible government contracts and quantum use cases, there is much more upside left. Especially because quantum computing is predicted to disrupt cryptography, communication, and machine learning, the US won't want to be left behind.

The quantum boom is just getting started and IonQ is likely to come out on top.

Lately, there is big momentum into nuclear stocks supported by volume and sustained rally. Take a look at CCJ SMR NNE OKLO.

Recently FN Media quoted that Industry insiders are saying that “the next big artificial intelligence opportunity could be Nuclear Power. As AI continues to drive unprecedented advancements across industries, the demand for robust, energy-efficient infrastructure to support AI computations has skyrocketed. Data centers, the backbone of the AI revolution, consume immense amounts of energy to power and cool their servers. To sustain this growth sustainably, companies are increasingly turning to nuclear power—an energy source capable of providing gigawatt-scale, low-cost, and low-emission electricity continuously.”

Nuclear energy can not only meet the massive energy demands but also aligns with global sustainability goals. Personally, I have shifted $$ to URA and continue to profitably trade many of these nuclear stocks. CCJ continues to be one my favorites in this space. Look at its 4hr chart. Sounds like it is ready to explode.

# Cost Cutting + Turn Around Strategy

$PBI is focused on 4 strategic initiatives, the main 2 which are highlighted here:

(1) **Paying down high-cost debt**. They've already started to execute this ([News Room](https://www.pitneybowes.com/us/newsroom/press-releases.html)) resulting in over $11M in annual savings and boosting 2025 EPS by $0.06. They have a lot more room to reduce debt and are making this the top priority  
(2) **Selling off Ecommerce Segment**. The Global Ecommerce segment had been struggling to achieve profitability over the past several years in the face of macroeconomic and industry headwinds (https://www.investorrelations.pitneybowes.com/news-releases/news-release-details/pitney-bowes-announces-value-maximizing-exit-path-global). Reducing this will help streamline costs, increase profitability, and allow for the focus on the core business

Why I am bullish on SMCI. #Calls ,1gwnoy2,Plus_Refrigerator839,2024-11-22 00:47:51,25,0.72,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gwnoy2/why_i_am_bullish_on_smci_calls/,"SMCI has been on a roller coaster this year but personally I think this one is set to be one of the greatest comebacks we have witnessed in a while.

Reasons why I am bullish on SMCI.

1. The company has launched next-generation products utilizing NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs and CPUs, which are expected to drive demand from AI and cloud service providers. Early testing has been promising, and production is ramping up
2. SMCI remains a key supplier for AI servers and infrastructure, benefiting from the explosive growth of AI and data center investments by major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Its servers, including liquid-cooled models, are crucial for high-efficiency AI applications
3. Despite recent challenges (which many other companies have went through may I add), SMCI's underlying business remains solid. Demand for its products is robust, driven by the need for scalable, energy-efficient server solutions in AI and cloud applications. SMCI has made significant progress toward regulatory compliance, including hiring BDO USA as its auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq to avoid delisting.
4. Recent insider purchases totaling 1.51 million shares indicate confidence in the company’s future prospects. Insider buying is often viewed as a positive signal regarding management's belief in the company’s growth potential and frankly my belief as well.
5. The company’s partnership with leading firms in AI and cloud services ensures a steady demand pipeline. Expanding client adoption of its innovative server solutions further strengthens its market position.

Personally I am extremely bullish. 1.51M shares bought is absolutely mind blowing they must know something retail doesn't and the stock is trading at a huge discount right now.

Calls it is.

Bear Case for Skechers ($SKX): Trump Tariffs Are Gonna Wreck 'Em ?🚨👟,1gwn0zh,Traditional-Year3847,2024-11-22 00:21:25,0,0.5,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gwn0zh/bear_case_for_skechers_skx_trump_tariffs_are/,"Alright, let’s break this down: Skechers is in **deep trouble** if Trump pulls the trigger on those **60-100% tariffs on Chinese imports**, and here’s why I’m betting they get smacked hard.

# The Core Problem: They’re Married to China

* **85% of Skechers’ stuff is made in China.** Let that sink in. They’re *fully dependent* on Chinese manufacturing, so these tariffs will blow a hole in their margins. they own 0 manufacturing facilities, they only have partnerships. You can imply that because of this, the stock price is mostly based on the brand value (intangible assets) and less on fixed assets.
* If costs go up, they’ll have no choice but to **jack up prices on sneakers**, which kills their whole differentiation strategy of being the affordable sneaker brand. People buy Skechers ‘cause they’re cheap, not for style or tech. Higher prices = sales tank.
* They don’t have any factories in the U.S., so moving production isn’t even an option. **Best case?** They relocate to Vietnam or wherever (which they already have about 10-15% there), but even then they’re still eating **10% tariffs**. 

# Legal and Relocation Headaches

* If Skechers tries to bail on their Chinese suppliers, they’re looking at **lawsuits for breaking contracts.** That’s just more costs piling up.
* Moving supply chains isn’t like flipping a switch. It’s expensive, takes forever, and the tariffs hit *right now.*

# China’s Gonna Clap Back

* Skechers makes a ton of money selling in China, but demand there is already slipping (you can verify their latest financial statements). Now imagine China retaliates against U.S. brands with **their own tariffs/restrictions.** Skechers gets hit on *both sides*—higher costs on imports to the U.S. and reduced sales in China. Double whammy.
* Let’s be real, Chinese consumers aren’t gonna rally behind Skechers. They’ve got plenty of local options.

# Skechers Knows They’re Screwed

* Read their financials. They’ve been **warning about this exact scenario** for years in the risks section. They know they’re exposed, but there’s nothing they can do fast enough to avoid the pain.

# TL;DR: Skechers is Toast 🍞

* **Higher costs? Check.**
* **Weaker sales in the U.S. and China? Check.**
* **Legal headaches and no easy solutions? Check.** This is shaping up to be a dumpster fire for Skechers, and I’m strapped in with puts to watch it burn.

# My Positions 💰:

* **Jan 17 $55 Puts**
* **April 17 $45 Puts**
* **June 20 $40 Puts**

Timing these across different months to ride the wave as the tariff drama unfolds. 

This is NOT a financial advice, do your own due diligence. it's not that complicated.

Dying to know your opinions.

If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only ""browser stocks"" that there are. At least the only one of any substance.

On the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.

I’ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I’ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.

I’ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I’m buying both to more or less hedge my bets.

I think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.

Summary:

Relay Therapeutics (RLAY) has recently faced significant selling pressure, leading to a 27.9% decline over the past four weeks. However, this downturn has pushed the stock into oversold territory, indicating a potential rebound.

**Key Factors Suggesting a Rebound:**

1. **Oversold Condition:** The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 23.42 suggests that the selling pressure may be waning, setting the stage for a potential price reversal.
2. **Upward Earnings Revisions:** Wall Street analysts have raised their earnings estimates for RLAY, signaling increased optimism about the company's future performance.
3. **Strong Zacks Rank:** RLAY's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates strong near-term price appreciation potential.

Too hard to justify current valuation (fair market value is probably in the high 630s where this will end up tomorrow)

2) The DOGE ""free app"" nonsense doesn't matter, but what does matter is DOGE's desire to simplify the tax code. This will affect the landscape of the tax prep software marketplace (by how much? Doesn't really matter, opens the door for more competition though)

3) Simplifying the tax code will mean that their biggest consumer segments (self-employed / small business) will need less of their services

4) The above is assuming there is no app. If there is... Don't you think the man who led the charge on **Paypal** can spearhead the improvement of existing government tax preparation apps (or develop new ones?)

The call will be interesting. My prediction : Slight earnings miss OR barely beat (same thing to investors) with guidance that doesn't encourage - **INTU 630 at postmarket**

Moving on. Why is Dutch-based $ASML down given their monopoly on lithography machines? NVDA, for instance, cannot grow without them. You need their gear to make AI chips and stuff. They legit own this space with the closest competitor being Cannon (yes, the camera company) which is a far cry from where $ASML is with its lithography equipment. 

$ASML profit margins are typically about 50%. In the third quarter (Oct. 15), revenue was €7.5B in sales with ~51% profit. The CEO said there’s been a slowdown in some areas like “memory” (I honestly don’t know what that means) and projects 2025 revenue to be €30-€35B (€28B is projected for calendar year 2024). 

This stock hit nearly $1,100 about six months ago. It’s down to ~$650. Their lithography equipment is required for AI.

There was no real way to invest in the s&p 500 unless you bought all 500 companies, constantly rebalanced equities, and rotated in and out new 500 companies... each time you'd get hit with capitol gains tax...

I'm not bashing on the s&p 500, it's a great investment and i own some.

$NOVA: Insiders can show you how and when you can double your money,1gwduno,value1024,2024-11-21 16:41:56,17,0.67,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gwduno/nova_insiders_can_show_you_how_and_when_you_can/,"I will keep this short. The background is down below.

$NOVA insiders bought a lot of shares since it dropped recently. This is when you can also make money if you join them in the trade. See below for theory and practical application of this trade set up. The market already reacted to this but not fully, in my opinion.

https://preview.redd.it/5m6mg7xil82e1.png?width=1297&format=png&auto=webp&s=62e3c84d323d7851d2c558efd4777f5865a274ed

**EDIT 11/22/24: even more insider buying as of yesterday:**

I traded the following options to bet on a rise and to finance the trade partially.

https://preview.redd.it/uk6avgdxk82e1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4f4c143b906eb1c7d17a4e519c148a1ef279e28

I am long this synthetic long position at a 10-3 ratio, meaning I am long 10 calls for each 3 short puts which I sold to finance the position. I am still at net debit, but much smaller if I just bought OTM calls.

The long calls are lottos which may or may not explode, but the short $4 puts are giving me long and sideways exposure to profit, as long as the stock is higher than $3.4. I picked this put strike because the insiders kept buying at these levels and there is margin of safety in the trade.

Good luck, trade small, and trade carefully.

**EDIT: After just 9 days, I closed the trade for nearly 3X the cost of my calls, and I closed the short put for over 75% gain. I am sure there is more room NOVA to run, but I had to take the profits. If it drops next week, which is possible, I will reenter with a smaller size. Stay tuned for the next informed trader based doubling.**

If you want to read the background on how insiders can show you when and how to double your money, see the original post and my follow up posts and trades. Here is a brief summary of my posts and trades:

1. VSTS - OG post, [posted on 5/10/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1coug3v/informed_traders_can_show_you_how_and_when_to/), stock was up a max 50% from the date
2. ATEC - [posted on 8/27/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f2qm8i/informed_traders_can_show_you_when_to_double_your/) the stock is now up 50% from the post date
3. PBF - [posted on 9/4/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f92x8n/pbf_insiders_can_show_you_when_and_how_to_double/),  the stock is now down 5% form the post date

Interestingly, I made most money on PBF because I sold puts to recover the cost of the vertical spread, and I am still short $30 December puts. I made good money on ATEC even though my duration was short, and I barely made any money on the first trade on VSTS because it was a complex spread which did not work with the slow rise.

Why Nvidia may not follow the same fate as Cisco ,1gwdl91,Zyriuse,2024-11-21 16:24:30,8,0.68,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gwdl91/why_nvidia_may_not_follow_the_same_fate_as_cisco/,"The Financial  times Lex with some fun facts on NVIDIA stock market dominance and what is much different about it compared to former market darling Cisco Nvidia’s fortunes increasingly drive everyone else’s. 

At $3.6tn, the company is the world’s biggest by market capitalisation, and makes up **7️⃣**% of the S&P 500 index. Back in 2000 when Cisco briefly became the planet’s most valuable company, its weighting was less than **4️⃣**% of the S&P. 

As of Wednesday, Nvidia’s stock accounts for **2️⃣4️⃣**% of the index’s gains this year.

The result is that when Nvidia does well, animal spirits 🦍 rise across the market. Bank of America analysts had calculated this week that investors were expecting a **1% index move** in response to Nvidia’s earnings — greater than the shift they expect from US inflation data later this month.

 In the short term, Nvidia has the enviable benefits of both scale and scarcity. 

Supply constraints keep prices high, and the company says demand for its new Blackwell chips will exceed its expectations of 'several billion dollars' in the current quarter. 

💸 Meanwhile, governments from Saudi Arabia to Denmark are seeking to build their own state-backed artificial intelligence initiatives, so while Silicon Valley depends on Nvidia, the reverse is becoming less true.

 That suggests the virtuous circle can continue. Whether that justifies a valuation of **3️⃣4️⃣** times forward earnings is up for grabs. Cisco stock, after a moment on top of the world, plunged during the dotcom crash, and never recovered.

 While Nvidia’s customers are paying hand over fist for chips driven by the promise of AI, it remains to be seen whether their customers — and their customers’ customers — will pay up for the resulting services too.💡

Nvidia has two things in its favour. First, its valuation is far behind the **1️⃣3️⃣0️⃣** times earnings Cisco enjoyed in 2000. Second, Huang has the benefit of hindsight and lavish profitability. Cisco’s earnings were **2️⃣0️⃣**% of its sales before the dotcom crash; Nvidia’s are nearly **6️⃣0️⃣**%.

 Spend that wisely, and his company will move the market for some time to come.""(+++Opinions are my own. Not investment advice. Do your own research.+++)",2024-11-21,0.9912,Positive,"['US', 'AI']"

It has informally gauged interest from prospective investors, including domestic private equity firms, the people said.

> A stake sale could also attract interest from Chinese conglomerates or other local companies with experience in the industry, some of the people said. Starbucks is still evaluating its options and hasn’t made a decision about whether to proceed, the people said. 

> Starbucks has faced pressure from activist Elliott Investment Management, which wants it to commit to reviewing its Chinese business, Bloomberg News has reported. In previous years, McDonald’s Corp. and Yum! Brands Inc. have carved out their Chinese operations and sold stakes to private equity firms to tap more growth and better cater to local tastes.

$RIVN: Riding to Valhalla,1gvxea5,LegitosaurusRex,2024-11-21 00:38:09,885,0.88,368,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gvxea5/rivn_riding_to_valhalla/,"Alright, degenerates. Rivian isn’t just the dorky little brother of Tesla anymore—it’s the ex-nerd who’s going to show up at the 10-year reunion ripped and in a tux, ready to steal the prom queen. This play has all the makings of a **10x banger** if you’re willing to hold on like your life depends on it. Buckle up, because this ride is going 0 to 69 faster than you can swipe right.

## Why Rivian Is About to Deliver

**Tesla’s Fumbling the Ball** 

Elon’s gone off the deep end and is alienating the very crowd that made EVs sexy to begin with. Progressive elites? Millennials? The kinds of people who buy organic kale and want their car to save the planet? Yeah, they’re turning the corner to RIVN, who’s out here whispering sweet nothings about sustainability, inclusivity, and not being a hot mess. Basically, Tesla’s stuck doing the walk of shame while Rivian’s already at brunch ordering mimosas.

**How Rivian Could Ride Trump’s EV Rollercoaster**

You’d think Trump and EVs go together like oil and water, but here’s the twist: RIVN could totally benefit from his likely “America First” policies. With Rivian’s production fully based in the U.S., any federal push for domestic manufacturing would be a tailwind. Meanwhile, Trump’s cozy relationship with Elon might have TSLA in the spotlight, but every infrastructure boost for Tesla chargers indirectly benefits RIVN since its vehicles now play nice with Tesla's Supercharger network. Most any other policy that benefits TSLA will help RIVN as well. Rivian’s set to snag the benefits without the baggage, making it the sneaky winner here. Everyone’s FOMOing into TSLA right now, but RIVN is the sleeper play here, and it’s only a matter of time until the market realizes this.

**New Models That’ll Make You Feel Things** 

Let’s talk about Rivian’s R2 SUV and its new lineup. Starting at $45K, it’s the hot-but-affordable option that’s ready to steal hearts (and market share). Tri-motor setup? Level 3 autonomy? Integration with Tesla’s Supercharger network? That’s not just sexy—that’s full-blown EV porn. This isn’t a one-night stand; Rivian’s building long-term market appeal. And if that $45k price tag isn’t inclusive enough for you Wendy’s employees, they’re adding a cheaper R3 model just for you (dumpster price point model still TBD).

**Efficiency: More Bang for Their Buck** 

Sure, Rivian’s been burning through cash faster than you can dump your paycheck into hookers and blow, but they’ve learned to keep it tight. Cutting the Georgia plant saved $2.25B, and now they’ve found [a sugar daddy in Volkswagen to the tune of $5 billion](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/rivian-volkswagen-production-forecast.html), exactly what they need to hold them over until their new models roll out. That’s efficiency, baby.

**Analysts Are Hot for RIVN**

 Some of the suits on Wall Street are swooning over Rivian. Their buy rating and price target of $15.67 give it a potential upside of 54%. They’re hyped about Rivian’s leaner operations, aggressive production targets, and a fat pipeline of new EVs. But there are still plenty of doubters who like losing money: [a short interest of 18%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rivn) means the minute this stock turns around, the squeeze will make it run.

RIVN shot from current levels all the way to $18 when the VW news first dropped, plus the recent pop to $12 when VW upped their commitment from $5B to $5.8B, but they’re now being valued the same as they were before the deal existed. People who think a cash injection of half the company’s market cap isn’t going to move the needle are delusional. Not to mention they have $6.73B cash on hand, and they’re only valued at $10B? Seems like a steal to me.

## The Risks (Nothing to See Here)

**Dilution** 

Rivian’s diluted more shares than a frat house dilutes vodka in jungle juice. But that jungle juice is funding some spicy R&D and scaling production, which means the hangover might just be worth it. And with VW’s cash infusion (with potentially more in the future?) and affordable models on the horizon, they might not need to rely on dilution going forward.

**Cash Burn**

Rivian’s like the guy spending money he doesn’t have to impress his date. Sure, it’s a gamble, but if those new models hit like I think they will, it’s a gamble that pays off big. Plus with Trump in the White House, do you honestly think he’s going to let American manufacturing jobs disappear when that’s all he talks about? Hell no, he’ll make sure RIVN stays alive until their investments pay off.

## TL;DR: 

RIVN isn’t just another EV play—it’s *the EV play* for those with the balls to handle a little risk. With Tesla already overvalued and fumbling its game, Trump protectionism acting as the ultimate wingman, and Rivian’s lineup of models hotter than a summer fling, the potential upside is enormous. Analysts see at least 50% upside, with room to double. This stock’s the real deal, and I’m strapping in for the ride.

MSTR arbitrage,1gvvi8f,Low-Refrigerator5031,2024-11-20 23:21:45,70,0.76,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gvvi8f/mstr_arbitrage/,"The main thesis against MSTR is that the company costs more than the bitcoin it holds. There ought to be an arbitrage here. Simple example - if the price to book ratio of MSTR is 200%, then you buy 1 BTC for $100k, short $200k of MSTR. On net you have $100k cash and zero exposure to the price of bitcoin.

The simple example fails because your broker won't accept BTC as collateral. But you could buy something broker-friendly instead, idk, maybe IBIT has a more normal price/book ratio. What is the pitfall there, why isn't MSTR being arbitraged down to its book value?",2024-11-20,0.0021,Neutral,"['MSTR', 'MSTR', 'BTC', 'MSTR', 'BTC', 'IBIT', 'MSTR']"
